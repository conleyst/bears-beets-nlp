"Oh, great. He’s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.",9,23,Dwight
You love your mom.,5,6,Kevin
"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.",5,22,Michael

"Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.",9,18,Pam
"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.",2,1,Michael
"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way.""",1,4,Jim
"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.",2,6,Jim
Thank you. Oh my gosh. It's really good.,8,14,Pam
"Dwight, what is the traffic like?",6,16,Michael
Hey.,3,9,Jim

"Jim, it’s fine. He’ll just get you on his cell phone and then that’ll go viral.",9,23,Andy
Ha!,5,6,Dwight
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.,1,4,Oscar
It's kind of serious.,3,11,Pam
Well some of us are trying to have a...,7,8,Michael
Maybe.,7,18,Michael
"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",2,21,Michael
"Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?",5,5,Andy
"Oh, no, I didn't know.",8,16,Ryan
"Hello, Peter.",9,12,Erin
Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.,3,20,Jim
What are you still doing not at your desk?,5,24,Andy

"It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.",4,4,Pam
"Well that was funny, that's why.",3,18,Ryan
"Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?",2,7,Michael
You can't always work 200 days though.,4,8,Michael
"Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.",3,18,Darryl
I am just following the website.,2,6,Pam
I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.,3,3,Dwight

I... Why would you just say something like that?,6,15,Jim

Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.,6,9,Michael
What do you think his chances are?,1,6,Pam
"Hey, do you guys have any other games?",2,3,Jim
Kevin! That's inappropriate.,1,3,Angela
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.,2,19,Kevin
"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.",4,4,Pam
Wow. Thank you.,3,14,Michael

"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?",4,13,Jim
"Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.",2,7,Jim
"Same team, Dwight.",1,5,Ryan
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.,7,21,Michael
"That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.",3,10,Andy
Will you be able to milk with those implants?,5,1,Dwight
Great.,4,2,Pam

It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.,9,11,Kevin

When did you find time to do all this?,8,14,Pam
You just twist your hand until something breaks.,3,14,Michael

You watched it.,9,22,Jim
"How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It’s cause I had a fallback. That’s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it’s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.",9,21,Andy
Do you really have to do that right now?,1,2,Jim
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.,5,20,Dwight
That's it? This is crap!,8,13,Dwight
Because of your slaves.,9,3,Erin

Fourteen years.,3,18,Michael
"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",6,6,Dwight
"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.",4,7,Michael
"Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.",2,18,Dwight
You have a penis?,7,4,Kevin
Squarepants?,3,14,Michael
"No. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.",4,12,Pam
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?,1,2,Dwight
"But before that, I have to do my presentation.",2,11,Michael
"I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.",3,15,Dwight
Even the fact that I'm gay?,6,1,Andy
Another one? Darryl and,7,23,Kevin
"Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will not say ""Ryan Howard is a temp."" It will say ""Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em.",3,1,Ryan
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.,5,14,Michael
"No, you don't. No, it - What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?",5,17,Michael
"Oh, my gosh, it’s choreographed!",9,23,Pam
I don't know what I'm gonna do!,5,5,Michael
I don't have a key.,3,5,Ryan
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number Romeo. Tango. G7745.,6,4,Dwight
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.,4,4,Oscar
Go to your room young lady!,7,8,Michael
So...,3,5,Jim
What does that one do?,9,6,Erin
What else?,1,6,Dwight
"Yeah, I don’t think that you understand wheels.",9,2,Kevin
I'll call him. I'll call David.,6,12,Michael
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.,4,14,Michael
"It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play ""moo""?",7,13,Oscar
"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",6,21,Michael
This is a new cardigan.,5,14,Pam
"Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top.",5,23,Michael
You were scared?,7,18,Pam
Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?,2,8,Michael
"Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?",7,11,Ryan
"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",4,1,Michael
"You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!",2,12,Dwight
This is Tito.,2,6,Michael
"I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.",5,22,Jim
What?,1,5,Michael
Nobody!,6,1,Pam
"OK, what am I thinking right now?",5,17,Dwight
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.,2,9,Pam
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.,3,15,Dwight
Awesome!,7,9,Kevin
I do!,3,22,Dwight
"Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.",5,7,Dwight
"Good night, Andy.",8,1,Phyllis
"I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.",8,2,Erin
"Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?",9,4,Oscar
"I got you, I got you!",4,2,Dwight
Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.,6,8,Dwight
It's all yours. Ah!,6,22,Dwight
Party looks fun doesn’t it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.,8,5,Jim
"No, I’m a dog person.",9,1,Oscar
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.,9,2,Pam
Still waiting on that check.,4,4,Andy
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!,9,20,Erin
"For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.",2,8,Dwight
So why is this on your resume?,9,13,Dwight
I didn't ask you to scratch it.,4,3,Angela
"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. Wanna share?",4,1,Michael
I'm excited about today. I love girl talk.,2,15,Phyllis
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.,8,4,Andy
Stanley is having an affir.,6,1,Michael
Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat…am i right?,8,16,Andy
"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! I kissed. We kissed.",6,21,Michael
"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",1,1,Dwight
"Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.",2,1,Pam
"Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?",9,16,Pam
Really?,4,11,Michael
"Yeah, I guess.",9,15,Andy
It's a common question.,3,17,Dwight
This is so stupid.,5,9,Michael
"Hello, Dwight.",2,7,Michael
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.,1,4,Jim
"Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?",1,4,Michael
Well that is... because... I am a genius.,5,12,Michael
Wow. Look at our parking lot.,4,14,Pam
Hey! Back here.,9,16,Jim
"Oh, this isn't good.",2,9,Phyllis
"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",9,15,Jim
Michael Scott here.,2,5,Jim
"Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...",2,3,Jim
"Oh God, here.",2,13,Dwight
"Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.",5,23,Michael
Acting!,4,14,Michael
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.,6,18,Kevin
Are you glad to be back?,8,14,Phyllis
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.,8,16,Andy
"Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.",8,13,Andy
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,3,8,Michael
I am nigh!,9,9,Dwight
"One, two, three. I did it! I did a cartwheel!",7,12,Erin
"I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.",6,4,Michael
"I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.",8,5,Erin
Don't change the subject.,9,9,Erin
What?,6,14,Michael
"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",1,4,Jim
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.,2,2,Pam
Thank you very much for that.,6,8,Dwight
"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?",7,1,Kevin
"Are you okay, Kevin?",8,6,Pam
"No, no. No spoilers. Please.",9,2,Dwight
"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.",4,9,Jim
This is my big sister Rachel.,9,23,Angela
"Shut up, woman!",9,22,Dwight
Take me to his house.,8,11,Dwight
"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.",9,15,Erin
"I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.",5,13,Andy
"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.",8,5,Dwight
"Ooh, Toby!",2,4,Pam
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.,4,7,Dwight
You are a liar.,2,9,Michael
Come on. Shh...,5,10,Michael
"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",4,1,Michael
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.,1,6,Dwight
Please.,3,22,Dwight
And we are going to straighten this out.,7,6,Michael
It is awful. You've made this day awful!,4,3,Angela
"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!",5,11,Dwight
No it isn't.,7,17,Michael
The three of us have all been chairmen before.,7,21,Phyllis
"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, ""Are you sure Michael?"" And you said ""Pam! Pam! Pam!"" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, ""Don't worry, it's just allergies."" Do you remember that?",4,13,Pam
You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.,8,21,Andy
Possibly.,2,21,Dwight
"I'm pretty fit. But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped. I got straight abs. I want gay abs.",5,1,Oscar
"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",6,15,Michael
Men find me desirable.,5,8,Dwight
Just keep it to yourself then.,6,1,Pam
"No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...",2,2,Michael
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,6,6,Dwight
"Oh, oh, oh, oh!",5,10,Jim
"I'm Jigsaw, idiot.",6,7,Dwight
He can't hear you?,2,8,Jim
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.,5,24,Dwight
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,2,21,Michael
Will do. Won't do.,7,5,Ryan
"Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.",5,15,Jim
"No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. You?",5,22,Michael
Women's urinals... uh...,5,17,Dwight
"Okay, okay. That's enough.",2,16,Dwight
Permission denied.,3,10,Jim
"You know what? Dwight, Dwight...",1,5,Michael
What are the themes?,4,4,Pam
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.,3,17,Michael
"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.",2,16,Michael
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.,8,24,Andy
"OK, yup.",3,11,Michael
You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!,3,8,Michael
How could it be more clear?,5,9,Dwight
"Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.",8,24,Dwight
Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!,9,3,Jim
Uh... hello!,7,23,Dwight
I got a knock-knock joke.,5,17,Dwight
"Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?",8,2,Jim
This is from Hooters.,2,13,Angela
That's good advice.,7,11,Pam
"Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.",4,9,Michael
"I can’t say we didn’t see it coming. But it’s a sad day when anybody is fired. We’re so sorry, Andy.",9,21,Oscar
Uh oh. What's so funny?,5,26,Michael
"Oh man, she is so pissed.",5,7,Andy
"Cool. Thank God they found her, too.",5,1,Kevin
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.,7,2,Darryl
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?,8,1,Dwight
It's not scary.,6,9,Michael
"Michael, nice tie or something.",6,23,Dwight
"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.",9,16,Andy
"Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.",8,11,Erin
"All right, Andy, please.",6,23,Michael
"Oh, anything bad?",2,3,Michael
Arrogance.,5,6,Michael
"This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.",9,2,Dwight
"Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.",8,13,Angela
Told you.,5,15,Dwight
"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.",9,10,Dwight
"Michael! Michael, pull over!",4,6,Jim
Wha-- wh--,9,8,Kevin
What?,2,19,Michael
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.,2,1,Angela
"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",7,11,Michael
"Sookehhh. Bill Compton, from True Blood.",7,6,Andy
"So, that's... It's great.",2,8,Jim
"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",9,15,Jim
"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn’t know. Um… actually I did tell Pam and we decided ‘no’. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I’m thinking there’s another conversation coming. And, it’s hard to know when that will be.",9,2,Jim
"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",6,2,Michael
Wow. High score?,5,22,Michael
No.,2,3,Michael
"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.",5,6,Jim
"I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.",3,18,Pam
"What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?",9,3,Andy
"I can... Yes, sensei.",2,6,Dwight
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.,7,14,Jim
"This is so, so stupid. And, God... that's my phone.",5,9,Michael
"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.",8,14,Pam
"The target-- it’s Oscar, isn’t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.",9,8,Dwight
I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!,7,13,Michael
"I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.",6,4,Pam
I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?,6,2,Michael
Tuna! I'm engaged!,4,14,Andy
Narddog.,8,4,Oscar
"Well, you have no right to ask those questions.",1,3,Oscar
"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.",9,16,Dwight
I thought you had to pee.,5,1,Michael
"Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",6,22,Dwight
Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.,8,2,Dwight
"Feast on this, Lewis.",8,23,Dwight
I finally mastered commitment.,9,23,Ryan
"She's right, it works. I would imagine.",9,10,Pam
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.,2,13,Ryan
It was Andy's idea.,3,23,Dwight
"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",3,11,Michael
I stretched before I came.,1,5,Ryan
Six years and two months.,4,8,Michael
"Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump.",3,19,Pam
"You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.",7,20,Michael
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?,9,16,Angela
"Um, sort of a spy, thriller...",4,4,Michael
"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?",2,11,Michael
"Oh, I have more.",2,18,Pam
"All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",7,6,Michael
Yes.,5,13,Michael
"Oh, no. I just--",5,1,Pam
"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",7,15,Michael
"That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place.",5,12,Oscar
Thanks.,2,6,Jim
I know. I know exactly what to do.,1,4,Dwight
Yeah!,4,5,Michael
Those are the bullet points.,6,10,Oscar
"If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?",4,14,Michael
"Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?",4,13,Jim
"But you can't today, we're doing inventory.",3,11,Pam
"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?",9,17,Pam
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.,5,21,Pam
"I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, ""Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?"" These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.",3,4,Michael
I don't think so.,4,4,Oscar
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.,7,15,Michael
"It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.",2,21,Angela
That's right. Yeah.Woman over speakerphone What do they do exactly?,4,14,Phyllis
"Okay, I get it. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke?  Michael, is this-- did I get the job?",5,24,Pam
"Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.",5,19,Michael
"Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.",7,9,Jim
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.,9,15,Erin
Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game?,3,4,Michael
"You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.",2,5,Angela
"Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.",5,26,Michael
Ahh! Dwight!,9,16,Angela
"So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.",1,5,Michael
"The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.",3,11,Dwight
"Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.",7,19,Jim
Yes.,6,10,Michael
"Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.",5,5,Michael
Empty mind.,2,13,Dwight
No. Angela! What are you saying?,9,8,Dwight
You got to... you got to give it to me again.,2,4,Ryan
"I'm sorry, sorry.",5,24,Michael
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.,8,24,Darryl
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.,9,10,Dwight
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.,5,22,Dwight
"Hey, Good luck.",6,2,Pam
Say it. Where?,7,14,Pam
Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns.,5,15,Dwight
You look so classy in that picture.,5,24,Ryan
No. You need to sign them all.,5,25,Angela
"We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.",6,7,Jim
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.,6,23,Andy
And that's noon. Exactly.,8,21,Jim
Nash.,3,8,Dwight
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.,9,18,Dwight
"I like that, so manager and co-manager.",6,2,Michael
"This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is ""Nights in Morocco"". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.",5,10,Phyllis
Battlestar Galatica.,2,9,Dwight
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.,5,25,Michael
They call it Scranton!,6,13,Michael
"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",7,24,Jim
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,6,16,Pam
"Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I’m waiting.",9,21,Jim
"Okay, fine. Cash it is.",6,18,Phyllis
"Last week I gave a fire safety talk. And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  Today, smoking is gonna save lives.",5,13,Dwight
We’re fine. Yeah. And I’m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn’t you be?,9,23,Pam
That is not correct.,4,2,Ryan
"Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?",4,1,Michael
"Okay. Pam, pros.",5,24,Michael
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?,7,9,Michael
"Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",2,14,Pam
Jan.,5,3,Jim
"Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.",1,6,Michael
See ya. See ya. Bye!,5,18,Jim
This one taken? No. Good.,3,8,Jim
"I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.",7,2,Phyllis
"Of course, ask me a que--  questions.",9,8,Oscar
You set a date?,5,4,Dwight
"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",5,13,Jim
"Hey, you ready?",1,5,Michael
"Hey, hey! Pam, Pam! Hey!",5,1,Michael
"No... no, this is just a stupid formality.",5,2,Michael
Cool music.,4,3,Angela
"Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.",7,11,Kevin
How long has it been going on?,5,11,Andy
"Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.",8,21,Andy
I can't get out of it!,2,7,Michael
I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.,6,20,Michael
"Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.",5,12,Dwight
Who?,4,2,Michael
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,1,3,Michael
Man.,8,15,Jim
"Hi, Jan. How are you?",2,8,Michael
"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?",7,17,Andy
"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.",7,1,Pam
"No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",7,6,Jim
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.,4,14,Michael
This is a huge sale.,3,5,Pam
"Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?",2,18,Michael
"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? Oh, come on.",2,10,Michael
$300.,6,7,Erin
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.,5,11,Oscar
"Holly, will you marry me?",7,18,Jim
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.,3,2,Michael
What are you so excited about?,9,22,Pam
Thanks. It’s on medium.,8,5,Erin
You're...you know what? I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.,5,1,Michael
That could really be fun.,3,10,Pam
I’m so sorry.,9,12,Pam
Know what?,5,7,Dwight
It's a pretty lame party.,5,1,Michael
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?,2,12,Michael
"Well that's a... pretty good reaction. Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",7,16,Michael
"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?",2,7,Jim
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.,2,17,Pam
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.,9,2,Dwight
"So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 300 in the morning.Pam I'm not drunk.",5,4,Jim
We need to sell her an elevator pass.,4,14,Michael
"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- Ow! What are you doing?",4,7,Michael
A bazooka. You remembered.,9,23,Dwight
"Pam, it wasn't her.",2,21,Jim
And you want me to come with you.,2,16,Dwight

Why's he making her laugh so much?,8,7,Pam
"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",2,21,Michael

Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.,6,12,Jim
"Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them.

“Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!”,9,18,Jim
Me too. We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.,5,26,Michael

Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!,5,13,Dwight

It's really sweet.,5,14,Pam
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?,4,4,Jim

"All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.",5,1,Darryl
I won an art contest today.,3,12,Pam
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.,8,12,Andy
I don't get it.,6,20,Phyllis
"Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?",8,4,Andy
"No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day.",7,24,Phyllis
"I'm not freaking out, Andy.",7,17,Pam
Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!,5,23,Michael
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.,6,17,Jim
Mama Bear!,4,5,Kevin
"Yeah, right?",6,1,Andy
"Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.",1,6,Jim
"If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?",7,13,Michael
"Let’s get this over with, Pam.",9,12,Kevin
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,7,6,Michael
"Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?",5,5,Darryl
"I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.",3,10,Angela
"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.",8,20,Dwight
"Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.",3,2,Michael
"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...",3,10,Michael
That laugh is so infectious.,6,11,Dwight
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.,4,6,Jim
"All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.",5,26,Jim
Just ignore him.,4,3,Dwight
"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",3,4,Michael
Stop that!,9,10,Pam
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,7,21,Michael
"Wait, why am I a racist?",3,9,Kevin
"Well, I think down’s better. Sweating pretty heavily down there.",8,2,Andy
In Philadelphia.,8,11,Jim
Is that really how you want to get this job?,8,16,Jim
"My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.",8,22,Kevin
We can custom make them.,3,12,Jim
The Huntsman.,5,7,Andy
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...,5,13,Michael
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.,5,22,Andy
Obviously.,2,6,Jim
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.,3,5,Ryan
"Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.",2,1,Dwight
Why don’t you pack it?,9,22,Angela

So can we come in?,4,9,Dwight
Unless you think he can’t handle it.,9,22,Jim
Tears of a clown!,8,22,Pam
"Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. Now, who was the one before Curly?",1,1,Michael
"I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day.",2,16,Pam
"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",3,1,Michael
"Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!",3,13,Andy
"Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.",5,26,Michael
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?,9,14,Darryl
"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.",8,10,Andy
Is this really the best use of our collective time?,8,2,Dwight
"Great, yeah, good.",8,24,Jim
That is my idea.,5,17,Dwight
"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",2,12,Jim
"Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...",6,6,Pam
"I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.",4,2,Ryan
"You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.",3,8,Phyllis
What are we doing?,4,6,Jim

"Hello, traitor.",5,22,Michael
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.,6,7,Jim
You.,4,12,Dwight

"Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.",7,10,Pam
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!,9,6,Kevin
"Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.",9,22,Jim
"You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.",4,11,Pam
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.,9,2,Pam
"PB and J, my mom's recipe!",7,19,Michael
"I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.",7,8,Andy
"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",5,12,Michael
A- ah--,6,5,Jim
"Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-",8,15,Erin
"Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere.",4,14,Jim
"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",4,7,Michael
"Yeah, but here’s the thing. I can’t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I’ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.",9,21,Andy
Okay. I'll keep working.,7,15,Darryl
"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...",8,13,Jim
"The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, ""Describe your act."" And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, ""What do you call yourselves?"" And the man says, ""The Aristocrats!""",3,22,Dwight
"He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?",3,18,Pam
"No, come on.",7,15,Erin
How do you know Michael Clump?,5,1,Michael

"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?",8,20,Andy
"At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.",3,16,Dwight
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,2,11,Dwight
You're bribing me?,6,8,Pam
Okay.,2,21,Michael
"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",6,10,Michael
"No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque.",4,2,Pam
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.,6,19,Michael
"Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.",4,3,Michael
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.,8,18,Jim
"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.",3,10,Pam
You shouldn't joke about that.,4,9,Angela
"Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.",1,6,Jim
I was very drunk.,8,21,Jim
"I know, just sayin'.",2,12,Michael
I used to be in HR. I was a Hell raiser.,2,12,Michael
"Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or...",2,2,Michael
"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",4,2,Michael
"Wow, that’s great. That’s great. Ok, good, let’s talk about that, ok?",9,1,Dwight
"Um... yes, I'll be right back!",4,2,Michael
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.,3,21,Dwight
"Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.",3,8,Andy
"Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.",7,7,Jim
"All right. Good. Thank you. Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here . So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.",3,8,Michael
"Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.",3,8,Andy
Tape recorder.,3,11,Dwight
"Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.",7,2,Erin
"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",2,21,Dwight
"There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...",6,16,Michael
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,6,20,Andy
"Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.",7,8,Michael
I had fish yesterday.,5,22,Dwight
"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.",3,2,Michael
"No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.",2,20,Michael
"My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.",9,3,Andy
"We need you, OK?",8,3,Andy
No.,7,12,Michael
Number one!!,2,19,Dwight
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.,7,6,Kevin

Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?,8,7,Andy
"Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...",8,3,Dwight
"Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.",2,8,Oscar
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.,6,22,Pam
"Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.",6,20,Michael
I just thought you should---,4,5,Jim
"I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. It's been a long journey... but I'm Santa Claus!",6,12,Phyllis
"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",5,12,Michael
"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.",6,1,Michael
"Let's be adults about this. Let's have sex one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.",5,8,Ryan
I like it.,5,18,Michael
Mornin' Jim.,3,19,Andy
Right.,5,19,Jim
"She's like, probably a tutor.",3,20,Andy
"I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",1,5,Michael
"Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.",7,24,Erin
"No, please don't do this, monkey.",4,2,Dwight
"You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?",9,11,Oscar
We're having a press conference?,3,20,Pam
"Dwight, are you talking about us?",5,22,Michael
"What do you mean, ""what""?",4,4,Michael
"I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, ""Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,"" and she's like ""I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication."" And I'm like, ""Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night."" And she's like, ""What the hell are you talking about?"" And I'm like, ""I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof..."" ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.",3,6,Michael
You're going to have to stop that. I can still feel it.,2,9,Angela
"Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.",8,3,Andy
"I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.",8,5,Pam
"No, we got a truck going out at 115. So, that's the busy time.",1,5,Darryl
"Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!",8,21,Pam
You have plans.,2,9,Michael
I don’t know. I’ve just always been really good at dancing.,9,23,Erin
We wait. Come to papa.,8,16,Dwight
Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.,6,16,Pam
"So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...",3,7,Michael
I am Dr. Cinderella.,9,5,Pam
"Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.",9,2,Andy
Pam?,7,2,Jim
"Again, never agreed upon.",8,7,Darryl
"All right, get out. Get out.",5,9,Michael
"Uhh, I don't know.",2,18,Michael
"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?",7,15,Pam
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.,9,4,Andy
Night-night.,8,20,Jim
Anything to get out of that office.,5,16,Pam
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!,7,17,Erin
"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.",7,7,Dwight
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.,4,1,Jim
"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",5,2,Michael
Yes. Do you have a day in mind?,6,16,Erin
I'll have a cup of a coffee.,5,12,Dwight
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.,5,6,Jim
"No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did right?",3,10,Michael
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.,6,4,Pam
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.,9,14,Darryl
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?,5,9,Oscar
Right.,6,10,Jim
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.,6,9,Jim
It'll be fun.,6,4,Angela
"Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.",6,16,Jim
"Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?",8,11,Andy

Be my mo manley.,2,11,Michael
"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",5,24,Dwight
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.,2,4,Michael
Not my problem.,5,10,Dwight
You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.,6,8,Dwight
"So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.",4,4,Oscar
"Hardy har har. Okay picture this Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?",7,17,Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.",7,12,Dwight
"No, that wouldn't-",5,15,Michael
"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.",5,24,Jim
I do not look worried.DunMiff/sys You do look worried.DwightK,4,3,Dwight
"Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.",1,3,Pam
"Kevin, what's four plus seven?",3,20,Angela
"You watching that commercial again? Why do you keep watching it, if you know it’s just gonna make you cry?",8,1,Jim
That's what I'm saying.,5,6,Jim
A year? You were together for a year?,6,20,Erin
"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...",6,16,Pam
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.,6,7,Kevin
Do you think... so you think...,7,3,Andy
The answer is yes.,9,16,Andy
"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",3,9,Michael
"Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a ""Where's Waldo.""",4,3,Michael
"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",3,2,Michael
For sure.,8,2,Kevin
"I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.",7,9,Pam
"Yeah, here we go. Ok.",5,18,Michael
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.,1,2,Dwight
Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.,6,8,Michael
"Oh man. It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.",2,12,Michael
"You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.",3,2,Phyllis
"Not important. Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.",5,24,Michael
Can you get me a cold water?,4,2,Ryan
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won’t be long. It’s the least I could do.,9,21,Oscar
"Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.",8,22,Pam
"I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?",9,2,Erin
"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. Welcome back, Stanley.",5,13,Michael
"Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?",2,17,Jim
"Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.",2,19,Dwight
The city of Atlanta.,8,5,Dwight
Okay. Okay. Yeah.,6,14,Pam
What can I do?,6,11,Michael
Why me?,5,9,Michael
Michael left.,4,4,Oscar
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?,3,20,Michael
"I'm very busy here, man.",4,12,Darryl
"Um, it's kind of private.",2,1,Pam

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.,7,16,Michael
Donate to the charity?,1,4,Oscar

"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",6,23,Michael

Clarinet.,2,9,Dwight
"It's, I mean.",8,10,Andy
"Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?",3,17,Jim
Don't shake our baby?,8,21,Pam
He says no.,7,6,Erin
"Okay... Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",7,11,Michael

Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You’re gonna watch me right?,9,21,Dwight
"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.",6,24,Pam
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.,7,2,Dwight
"I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.",6,10,Ryan
Your hands.,3,10,Andy
He looks great.,5,8,Dwight
We already have a buyer.,7,9,Michael

Dwight.,8,18,Jim
I mean...,8,15,Andy
Hey.,8,18,Jim
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.,2,2,Pam
"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.",8,7,Dwight
Ahhh! Excellent.,2,15,Michael
"Oh, just put these on the group tab.",2,1,Kevin
Done.,5,23,Dwight
"Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",7,11,Michael
"But Phyllis, it's not his baby.",5,3,Kevin
"Alright, you got it.",8,10,Andy
Did you say Karen?,4,6,Dwight
I know where this is goin'.,5,13,Michael
"Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?",1,6,Dwight
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.,5,19,Phyllis
There's no fires within eight miles of here.,8,11,Dwight
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?,7,11,Michael
"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.",2,10,Michael
Stanley! Bo banley.,2,11,Michael
Take a sip of that.,5,7,Michael
"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",6,8,Michael
"Yeah, we locked him up for two years.",5,7,Michael
"You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.",4,4,Jim
Yep. Take care.,9,22,Darryl
Yes we do.,4,2,Michael
"Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.",5,13,Pam
"As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.",2,17,Michael
"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.",8,10,Jim
Okay. Sure.,7,11,Michael
"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",4,2,Jim
Ugh.,9,21,Angela
I'm bringing someone.,2,10,Phyllis
"Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.",1,4,Michael
They were stolen?,6,4,Kevin
(Bleep),8,14,Dwight
"The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.",2,1,Oscar
"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.",3,7,Michael
You're taking away our bathroom?,2,1,Pam
They could do better.,5,12,Dwight
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.,6,18,Erin
"Okay, you do not have to do this.",9,7,Pam
With all my heart.,5,17,Dwight
"A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.",4,1,Michael
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.,6,7,Jim
"I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...",7,15,Kevin
"I don't know yet, I have to call you back.Voice #1 on phone You have to give us something...",4,3,Andy
Sorry about that.,6,23,Jim
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.,4,2,Michael

I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.,3,22,Angela
Why don't... hey.,4,13,Michael
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,6,10,Dwight
Looks that way.,8,9,Darryl
"And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.",9,7,Oscar
"Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?",3,23,Jim
Why are we doing this?,2,10,Oscar
How late do we have to work tonight?,6,17,Michael
"Hey, you're making me spray!",4,6,Dwight
"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.",8,13,Andy
"Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?",9,22,Dwight
"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",8,20,Pam
"Well, I'm texting him, so.",6,10,Michael
Wow. Are you that bored?,8,15,Jim
"So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?",7,12,Phyllis
"I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?",3,19,Jim
...is really tight.,3,8,Dwight
"Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.",2,13,Michael
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,1,1,Pam
"Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.",5,12,Kevin
"I know, right?",6,12,Andy
"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.",1,6,Michael
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?,7,14,Jim
Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.,4,3,Andy
"Hey, aren't you an actor?",8,13,Erin
"Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.",5,20,Pam
Whoa! Hold on.,7,12,Darryl
Doesn’t mean you’re the best singer ever. Dick.,9,5,Andy
"No, we have to cancel the party.",7,11,Michael
Yeah... ugh. She's... you don't deserve her. Alright.,4,10,Michael
"Paper material, ma'am.",7,24,Darryl
"I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character ""Mikanos"", is just a little added flava. ""Mikanos"" is loosely based on another character I do, ""Spiros"", who is more about the ladies.",7,13,Michael
"Really? Hey, um... Old lady Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?",6,22,Dwight
"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.",2,6,Michael
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,4,1,Jim
"Uh, yeah, ream.",2,6,Jim
That's also not true.,4,12,Jim
That didn't happen.,8,13,Angela
"Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?",4,14,Angela
"Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!",4,14,Michael

"Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.&nbsp",1,1,Dwight
Go ahead. I think it's your turn.,6,4,Pam
"...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.",4,2,Ryan
"That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male ""hanging out"". Call the cops!",8,22,Dwight
It is?,6,6,Michael
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.,7,8,Kevin
"No! You idiot! Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.",5,18,Michael
He knew all along!,6,11,Dwight
"I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.",9,20,Dwight
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.,5,20,Michael
Permission to speak on the record?,6,2,Michael
They could call at any second now. Oh God...I better call.,4,5,Michael
Not cool.,9,20,Andy
You apologize to me right now.,7,11,Dwight
Of course not.,5,23,Michael
"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",3,2,Pam
"Mmm... nah, that's too young.",4,10,Michael
"Thank you. Yeah,",9,23,Andy
It's nice to see you doing so well.,7,4,Michael
Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here...,7,19,Andy
"Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?",4,2,Angela
Fire guy,4,2,Andy
"Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I’ve been doing this thing-",8,1,Erin
"No, Kevin --",8,17,Oscar
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.,2,16,Michael
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.,2,4,Dwight
The girls school?,5,25,Phyllis
"Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?",5,25,Dwight
"Uh, I heard it.",1,5,Jim
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.,3,21,Andy
"No, I'm not doing that.",4,6,Jim
Ha! This is for real this time.,9,2,Dwight
Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.,6,9,Erin
We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.,1,1,Jim
No that's... not how it works.,5,2,Andy
I think he's just making her laugh.,8,7,Pam
Nice try. Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.,2,3,Dwight
I will stay here and run things on this end.,2,16,Dwight
Jan... Ryan.,5,12,Michael
"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",6,5,Dwight
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.,6,11,Erin
"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.Mr.",1,2,Michael
These sure are pretty dogs...,6,15,Andy
"Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible.",6,2,Pam
"I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.",8,16,Ryan
Packer said it.,2,2,Kevin
Yeah.,6,5,Michael
And I will take you all down.,7,14,Darryl
How long does it take to get the results?,8,24,Angela
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. Pam?,6,4,Kevin
Hey.,5,22,Jim
Good work.Mary-,2,9,Michael
"No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.",2,13,Michael
Beard.,4,2,Michael
"Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.",4,11,Michael
You guys lost four pounds.,5,1,Darryl
"Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?",5,13,Darryl
"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.",7,18,Michael
"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",8,13,Jim
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  Oh.,9,23,Dwight
It's too big of a pill to swallow.,7,10,Kevin
"Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.",5,20,Michael
"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?Mr.",6,4,Jim
What happened to you?,2,11,Jim
Keep them.,9,17,Dwight
"Hey! It's on the list, everybody.",6,7,Dwight
"And you, why are you still here.",7,21,Michael
Good one.,5,6,Jim
It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. It was not me.,2,14,Ryan
Or enough for everyone?,7,1,Pam
How did we do it?,3,7,Michael
"Oh, well, that's fine.",5,16,Michael
They're the same picture.,7,24,Pam
I've been here 8 years and I've never... Rude.,5,25,Oscar
Oh- She's not here?,5,15,Michael
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.,8,12,Erin
"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, ""That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.""",5,5,Pam
We need to assemble the five families.,4,10,Kevin
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?,5,25,Dwight
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.,4,10,Kevin
Stop it Kevin!,9,11,Angela
"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.",1,1,Dwight
Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.,8,7,Dwight
Yep.,4,5,Jim
"It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!",4,12,Kevin
A thousand.,8,10,Erin
I feel awful.,9,13,Pam
"Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl’s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we’ll get this started.",9,22,Erin
Crystal.,9,16,Andy
"Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.",9,10,Pam
"Well, it has certain connotations.",1,2,Michael
"Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.",9,19,Andy
"Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.",2,17,Michael
"Stanley, could you look up ""accomplices""?",4,3,Oscar
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,3,5,Dwight
"Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.",6,16,Michael
You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...,2,18,Michael
"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",2,15,Michael
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.,1,4,Michael
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?,5,26,Dwight
"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.",6,11,Pam
Do I look like I am joking?,5,6,Michael
A little.,2,14,Pam
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,5,13,Michael
"I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.",8,21,Andy
"Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?",9,6,Angela
Oh. Hmm.,5,6,Andy
Really make one.,4,14,Dwight
"Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.",4,6,Oscar
"No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.",7,4,Dwight
"Michael, could I talk to you privately?",6,16,Erin
I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.,6,6,Michael
"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.",3,11,Michael
Life is Downton Abbey.,8,22,Pam
"Seven minutes. … Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. .",8,16,Dwight
Yes. Me do.,8,2,Kevin
Yeah.,4,3,Michael
"Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. Shut up .",3,4,Jim
"No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.",5,6,Michael
Scranton rules!,4,6,Dwight
"No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.",1,5,Michael
I’m doing it for us.,9,23,Pam
"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?",7,1,Michael
"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",2,15,Pam
"I am makin' it happen, sergeant.",3,18,Michael
Wow! There it is.,4,1,Jim
"Oh, no, not while I'm here.",2,16,Jim
"Well, this...",2,11,Michael
"Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?",2,10,Angela
"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...",1,6,Michael
"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",8,8,Jim
"I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.",3,19,Pam
"As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.",4,2,Ryan
Thank you.,6,11,Pam
"Sure. Dooo. Tough room. Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",5,10,Andy
"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.",2,14,Michael
"Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.",9,23,Jim
"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, then... ""How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.""",7,11,Jim
Snowboarding?,6,8,Michael
"Aaaaaand, go!",3,22,Michael
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it.,2,19,Michael
"Glen, could you excuse us?",6,22,Darryl
"Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.",8,4,Pam
Hey boss. Got a minute?,3,12,Andy
"Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?",8,5,Erin
"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away.",2,2,Michael
"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",1,4,Dwight
My mom also makes the best salsa.,7,18,Ryan
Come on.,8,7,Dwight
We've been through this.,4,14,Jim
Hungrier.,8,18,Kevin
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.,3,9,Jim
"Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.",3,16,Oscar
No this is Holly.,7,4,Michael
"Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.",4,3,Michael
"""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.",1,2,Michael
Damn you.,3,19,Dwight
"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that’ll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate.",9,13,Jim
"And we all know, baseball does not last forever.",9,18,Darryl
"0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. It really makes us look unprofessional.",5,17,Pam
"Yeah, what do you think that's about?",1,4,Jim
"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",4,7,Jim
"Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.",3,12,Dwight
"Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.",2,17,Michael
That's a tough one.,9,6,Oscar
"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?",7,17,Andy
"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?",1,6,Michael
Did you look over here?,3,10,Ryan
You did!,5,21,Michael
I'm out of answers Jan.,4,4,Michael
"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",8,10,Jim
"Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.",3,1,Michael
"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",7,16,Jim
You're a jerk.,1,1,Pam
"Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!",6,8,Dwight
Smart.,9,18,Jim
Maybe she hit me. You ever think of that? She hit me? I don't know whose fault it was. I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,4,1,Michael
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?,5,6,Pam
"We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.",3,6,Andy
What?! That would've solved all my problems.,2,5,Michael
I need you.,9,16,Dwight
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.,8,15,Dwight
"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.",4,12,Jim
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?,5,22,Michael
"Dwight, what are you doing?",8,23,Jim
"OK, well I know. You told me that several times.Mr.",1,2,Michael
It's your delivery...,2,17,Michael
"Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.",6,9,Andy
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.,5,9,Michael
"Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.",5,21,Jim
Indubitably.,3,19,Michael
"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",8,9,Dwight
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.,7,24,Phyllis
"Check again, Ryan Howard.",4,11,Ryan
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.,9,23,Dwight
I'm not... I'm not going to have...,7,12,Pam
Uh oh! Oh! Oh!,5,21,Andy
"Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.",7,6,Ryan
"Ow, ow!",6,4,Andy
"So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?",9,18,Dwight
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?,6,7,Michael
"Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?",3,20,Jim
"Oh, it's really cold here.",5,5,Michael
"Before I go, may I?",8,13,Dwight
Hold me!,5,3,Dwight
She's babysitting?,7,3,Andy
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,3,7,Pam
Up to you.,3,19,Andy
"I, uh... I let her win.",5,4,Michael
"Oh, sorry gotta go.",7,14,Jim
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.,4,9,Jim
"Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?",5,22,Michael
No. Michael. Michael.,5,13,Jim
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.,2,22,Michael
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.,7,2,Pam
Same thing.,2,3,Dwight
"All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!",3,1,Michael
Whoa. Awesome.,5,5,Oscar
"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.",5,21,Dwight
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.,7,18,Michael
"Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.",4,4,Oscar
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,6,4,Pam
"Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.",5,14,Michael
"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole ""Woody came to life"" thing so quickly?",7,11,Jim
Lurk much?  I miss Pam.,6,11,Michael
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?,6,14,Dwight
I sorta like the old way.,7,19,Michael
"Oh, you think they’re my only friends? I’ve got way more friends than that, and they’re all better than the losers who work here.",9,13,Dwight
"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",1,3,Michael
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so…,8,5,Erin
"Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me",3,5,Jim
"I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...",3,17,Michael
Saying I love you is not the words...,8,4,Andy
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?,3,20,Angela
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.,6,4,Erin
Ow! He pinched me!,6,4,Angela
"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?",4,6,Jim
I'm his! His... wife.,9,14,Angela
"Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great.",1,6,Jim
Exactly the way it is.,9,1,Pam
"No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?",1,6,Pam
Can I be team captain?,1,5,Dwight
How as being a minority affected you?,6,21,Dwight

"Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.",8,17,Dwight

Me likey!,6,18,Andy
"Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.",6,6,Michael
"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.",6,10,Jim
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.,5,13,Oscar
I’m very sorry.,8,17,Jim
Jan called me about your little meeting!,3,3,Michael
And that is Dallas.,7,18,Kevin
That's what makes it so wrong.,6,22,Michael
"Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.",3,5,Jim

Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.,8,8,Phyllis
"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",6,20,Pam
So when are you due?,5,14,Pam
"Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore.",5,12,Jim
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?,3,9,Pam

Yes it is!,6,17,Michael
Sales is not all in here. It's also in here.,3,5,Dwight
"They just didn’t turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.",8,8,Andy
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.,7,9,Michael
"I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?",4,12,Ryan
"So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?",6,7,Phyllis
"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",6,9,Jim
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,5,10,Dwight
"Okay, why are you calling Jo?",7,23,Dwight
"Surprise! As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.",5,18,Michael
"All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.",7,24,Jim
You said that?,3,3,Dwight
"The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Ring"". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.",7,13,Erin
She thought I was your boyfriend.,6,4,Kevin
When I let him come to my pick-up game...,1,5,Michael

"Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.",6,16,Pam
Right there. Ah.,3,2,Michael
Not really.,2,13,Ryan
"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way no, I do not.",4,7,Dwight
Oh boy...,4,12,Jim
"Just going to walk over here- whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!",8,7,Dwight
Butt honking.,7,15,Kevin
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?,4,2,Phyllis

It’s great.,9,21,Jim
Same thing.,1,5,Dwight
"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",2,20,Michael
"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!",8,11,Dwight
"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.",7,16,Michael
"What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.",3,18,Angela

"How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.",7,5,Michael
"Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",8,2,Pam
"Well now hold on it, it-",8,6,Andy
"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!",8,11,Andy
"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.",5,18,Jim
"No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.",5,22,Dwight

"Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?",7,7,Jim
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.,2,5,Michael
"There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?",3,19,Darryl
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.,5,7,Michael
I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--,6,4,Andy
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.,2,19,Kevin
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.,8,20,Phyllis
"Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.",1,4,Pam
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.,7,12,Dwight
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.,4,3,Pam
Please take note of the new color-coding system.,7,23,Dwight
Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.,2,14,Dwight
"Not helping, tuna.",8,11,Andy
What about this bottle of power drink?,1,6,Ryan
That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours.,3,19,Kevin
"Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.",3,6,Angela

"Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.",3,17,Jim
"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!",8,1,Dwight
"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",5,17,Michael
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?,7,12,Michael
"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",6,2,Jim
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,7,18,Jim
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.,6,10,Oscar
"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.",3,3,Jim
"Well, turns out he actually made it up there.",8,20,Jim
"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.",6,9,Dwight
"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I’ll tell you how we can beat it.",8,7,Andy
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.,2,17,Michael
"There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -",6,14,Michael
"Maybe some Italian. ""... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"" Chinese? ""who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.""",3,21,Michael
"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",2,10,Michael
"Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",6,5,Pam
"Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.",6,16,Jim
"Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.",3,5,Andy
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.,8,6,Jim
Extension 147.,7,21,Erin
"Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.",4,14,Michael
"Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.",7,12,Oscar
"Pam! Pam, look out! Erin’s gunning for your job!",9,11,Kevin
"Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.",9,6,Dwight
Who knows what the belt is for?,8,6,Darryl
"Message in a Bottle, The Postman...",8,3,Dwight
"Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.",2,9,Michael
Did you cry?,6,3,Jim
Yes!,6,2,Michael
That sounds nice.,8,2,Pam
"'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... like, forget it.",8,8,Kevin
"Yes I am, as a matter of fact.",8,15,Andy
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!,5,11,Andy
"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?",5,11,Jim
"Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?",1,6,Michael
"Uh, I don't need one.",2,3,Michael
You have a gun in your desk?,7,8,Pam
I use the word “guys” a lot when I'm nervous...guys.,8,14,Andy
Goodie.,4,3,Angela
Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.,3,14,Pam
"Would you stop it, please?",3,18,Michael
I don't even know what that card said.,6,15,Andy
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.,8,18,Kevin
"All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.",5,26,Michael
Probably.,7,9,Angela
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,2,3,Jim
"How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000.",5,23,Ryan
"No, it's not. It's lower.",1,5,Michael
Eight minutes!,8,9,Dwight
"Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?",1,5,Dwight
"No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.",3,18,Michael
I've dumped better than Erin.,6,16,Kevin
Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah!,2,15,Michael
"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.",8,18,Jim
"Kelly, you know what...",2,19,Jim
Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!,6,11,Andy
"It's a fake wheel, dummy.",2,11,Michael
"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.",9,15,Jim
"Is it, is it fake?",6,12,Pam
"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?",4,14,Michael
"I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.",7,19,Andy
"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",8,7,Jim
"Alright, well, cool. Still deciding?",2,13,Michael
"We think you made a big, big mistake.",9,10,Phyllis
"Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.",7,11,Oscar
Of course I saw it.,3,15,Dwight
"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",9,13,Dwight
"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.",5,13,Dwight
Just do your best! I have faith in you.,7,21,Michael
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,4,5,Michael

"Ok, let's do this thing.  Wish us luck.",2,7,Michael
"Hey, Josh, how ya doing?",3,2,Michael
"Well, we don't--",5,23,Michael
"Well, um, you know maybe you’re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--",9,5,Erin
"Hey guys! Guess who's back! AHHH! OH, GOD!",3,18,Andy

"Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies",5,12,Michael

Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.,6,7,Andy
"I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.",3,11,Michael
Call me when you get in.,5,1,Jim
I need to go over some details with you.,2,20,Dwight
I am a person.,9,7,Dwight
"Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!",3,19,Michael
"Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?",2,6,Jim
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.,3,5,Jim
"Yeah, it sounds like it.",8,12,Andy

In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!,8,2,Angela
"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the...",1,3,Pam
"Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?",8,24,Dwight

"William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do.",3,20,Andy
"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.",1,1,Michael
"Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I’m gone.",9,8,Jim
"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",8,13,Andy
How is the new boss? Tough. Do people respect him? They have to. Do they like him? Irrelevant. They do not. And I hate them back.,3,23,Dwight
I want her to meet Michael.,6,19,Pam
"Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.",7,9,Ryan
Can you tell us what happened?,3,21,Pam
I can eat.,5,24,Ryan
That is right. Don't make any more of it.,6,22,Pam
You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.,6,9,Dwight
"No, that's not as much fun. You know what?",1,5,Darryl

Pete and I work well together -- not that there’s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I’m into girls. Not that I’m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?,9,12,Erin
"""You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.""",8,16,Darryl
Resent you?,9,22,Jim
What kind of offer?,9,21,Jim
"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.",2,10,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait.",5,13,Dwight
Do you?,1,3,Jim
That's yours?,9,6,Erin
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.,9,18,Jim
"Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.",5,4,Michael
"Time to make the donuts.  Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on.  De-nied!",5,23,Michael
I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.,5,8,Michael
"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!",8,17,Dwight
"Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.",3,9,Michael
No trades.,2,10,Dwight
Some candy.,6,6,Pam
"Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.",7,8,Jim
What's the next one?,2,21,Oscar
"Don't be fooled by the phrase ""dust bunnies."" They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.",2,13,Dwight
"Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.",3,4,Michael
Could have gone better I guess.,3,23,Michael
"Okay, just throw out all the empties.",1,6,Michael
"That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.",6,13,Michael
"Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!",5,6,Michael

"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?",3,9,Andy
"Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights.",2,1,Pam
"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 1030, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.",7,23,Jim
I always set it at 69.,2,17,Kevin
"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?",4,12,Michael
"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.",5,8,Jim
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.,8,9,Andy
"I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.",6,19,Jim
"I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. Mi-chael! Mi-chael!",7,5,Michael

About two more minutes .,4,7,Dwight
I'm gonna lose 'em.,7,21,Andy
"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.",7,23,Dwight
"Come here, come here. Let's go.",9,20,Angela
"Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.",7,3,Michael
"OK, fine, yeah. that’s one guy’s opinion!",9,5,Andy
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.,2,1,Pam
Pull over!,9,22,Dwight
What are you doing?,3,15,Jim
"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",2,22,Michael
yeah!,5,19,Michael
"Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.",7,5,Michael
"""You have won a tiny Dundie.""Guy at bar Sing it Elton.",2,1,Michael

"Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.Man on",1,3,Michael
Thanks again by the way.,6,17,Jim
"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant.",6,2,Michael
"And they do, your parents, love you very much.",2,18,Dwight
"Yeah, how do you play?",6,19,Andy
“Side effects of EMF include headaches...”,9,4,Jim
Sabre... It’s time... to come home.,8,17,Ryan
"No I’m just, I’m saying, what would happen if they didn’t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?",9,5,Pam
Yick.,5,16,Michael
Did you have fun at Benihana's?,3,10,Angela
"Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight’s meeting.",8,2,Andy
"Hello, what do we have here?",8,16,Ryan
"Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.",6,24,Michael
Not a word.,9,15,Dwight

"Okay, that's it.",7,12,Pam
"Okay, wait, wait.",8,13,Jim

"Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.",3,12,Angela
"No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.",7,5,Andy
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.,3,16,Michael
But I'm the first in the office?,3,4,Michael
"Oscar, did you bring it?",4,6,Pam
"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",6,4,Michael
"Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The ""Hottest in the Office"" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!",2,1,Michael
"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.",4,7,Jim
It wasn't either of you.,8,10,Andy

"As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.",2,17,Pam
"So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, ""No way. You can't reserve seats."" And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.",5,3,Pam
"So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?",5,22,Michael
"Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",3,22,Michael
"The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.",9,3,Oscar
"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.",4,2,Michael
I think that's from Big.,2,12,Kevin

"Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.",3,20,Oscar
"There, there...",1,3,Michael
"Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.",2,22,Pam

You're right. That's good.,3,10,Michael
"Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?",7,20,Pam
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,8,13,Dwight
"Michael, she's perfect for you.",7,18,Pam
"Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.",2,3,Jim
Second drink?,2,1,Jim
No! Okay. All right.,7,5,Michael
"Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.",9,20,Pam
Here we go.,7,9,Michael
I have something to do.,7,8,Dwight
Catching butterflies.,8,16,Jim
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.,2,10,Ryan

Jim's bedroom.,2,9,Pam
"How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?",8,22,Phyllis
I heard it from Erin.,6,1,Andy
"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay?  And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.",5,24,Michael
That’s what he says.,9,22,Pam
Really? Oh... Then here we are.,7,8,Dwight
Yeah.,4,11,Michael
Oh.,4,2,Jim
Dwight! Are your legs broken?,5,11,Jim
"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",1,3,Jim
OK.,5,16,Michael
I can’t.,8,2,Andy
Ha-ha.,9,2,Pam
What?,6,10,Michael
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. You are now sexy in your culture.,5,7,Michael
"Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie...",5,7,Michael
And remember Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.,9,20,Andy
He's seriously awful!,7,17,Pam
Is he really five pounds?,8,13,Erin
"Por favor, tequila seoor.",2,11,Darryl
"Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!",8,21,Oscar
I promised I wouldn't tell.,8,13,Oscar
Whew.,5,25,Erin
"I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read ""Lonesome Dove"" three times.",5,1,Michael
"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",2,10,Michael
"No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.",4,11,Pam
Oh boy! What's happening?,9,2,Kevin
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.,3,5,Michael
"Guys, guys!",6,16,Michael
"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...",8,13,Dwight
Nope. Different movie.,7,5,Jim
"Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet.",3,11,Dwight
"Are you okay, what's wrong?",7,10,Pam
"That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around.",5,1,Ryan
"Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!",2,15,Dwight
"Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't.",6,11,Erin
"Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.",2,4,Jim
It's a nice tux.,2,22,Pam
"Oh, OK! OK!",5,3,Michael
Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.,3,18,Angela
"Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?",8,17,Kevin
"You know, Jim’s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.",9,19,Pam
What happened?,5,1,Jim
Nope. It's over.,8,14,Jim
"It's not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys.",8,6,Dwight
It sounds mean.,2,10,Angela
Those are fully staffed as well.,8,9,Andy
They said the both of you.,6,7,Erin
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!,8,20,Pam
"Yeah, that's a good one.",5,3,Angela
And the desk.,7,23,Jim
Here... Who's here?,3,8,Michael
Dwight gives the best back massages.,8,12,Erin
Everything... Everything.,7,17,Ryan
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.,7,21,Dwight
The watermark... it's a one time thing.,3,20,Michael
"All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.",1,5,Darryl
You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?,6,8,Michael
"Well, I should hope so. Who is this?",5,6,Jim
"What'd you do, Prison Mike?",3,9,Jim
I can't tell you.,2,9,Michael
"Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?",9,18,Pam
"It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.",6,24,Michael
"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",6,3,Michael
Okay. I’m really sorry I told the guys I’d be there for the board meeting.,9,13,Jim
"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world.",6,22,Michael
"Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.",3,18,Dwight
"Um, nerthing?",5,21,Andy
"It's really good to see you, man.",3,2,Jim
"Russell, I’m dressed like George Michael.HCT Member #3 I thought you were Adam Lambert.",9,5,Andy
"Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.",7,8,Jim
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-,4,14,Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -",6,10,Michael
Appalling. Eye sore. Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!,7,20,Dwight
"Okay, I got it.",5,13,Michael
"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. So you had a bad day-",9,16,Andy
"Okay, let's hear it.",9,9,Erin
"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",6,22,Michael
"Uh, on or off?I.D.",2,21,Phyllis
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.,4,9,Michael
Good. What's up?,2,4,Ryan
"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",6,22,Jim
See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.,8,2,Kevin
Because it's better. Because it's more special.,2,10,Michael
"Yeah, yeah I'll see them.",5,8,Ryan
"Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.",5,21,Michael
"Knock, knock. Oh!",8,13,Oscar
Thank you Sandra!,9,6,Dwight
I can't. I just got a manicure.,2,6,Jim
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.,8,7,Oscar
This has been a really tough time.,9,16,Andy
"Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.",3,5,Ryan
"Aaagh, aaagh!",3,22,Dwight
I got that cutie behind the counter.,7,12,Darryl
Could be a bat weevil… Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?,8,16,Dwight
Morning Michael!,5,21,Pam
It's still on a bike path though right?,7,10,Jim
"You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...",3,15,Michael
"I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.",7,8,Michael
"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.",8,7,Pam
"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.",6,10,Pam
"Oh, I bet Jim goes too.",4,1,Kevin
So you still missing Ryan?,4,3,Darryl
"Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.",2,22,Michael
"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.",7,15,Andy
"Yeah! Okay. Hey David, I’m back.",9,7,Dwight
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.,8,3,Ryan
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.,3,5,Angela
Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.,6,16,Michael
"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.",6,23,Pam
"Huh, huh, huh!",8,18,Dwight
This is what’s under the blanket.,8,2,Andy
"No! You’re not helping, Trevor!",9,8,Dwight
Give it back to me now.,6,20,Pam
I'm not going to make this call.,5,12,Michael
"It is not your business, Dwight.",3,3,Michael
"Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.",9,16,Erin
"Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...",7,13,Andy
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.,7,5,Jim
"Huh. Hit the road, jack.",8,18,Darryl
"No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!",7,13,Kevin
That was fantastic.,3,8,Andy
"Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that ""May your hats fly as high as your dreams."" ... That was a pretty good line.",3,16,Michael
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.,6,1,Dwight
Well...,6,1,Michael
"Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- it's great.",3,13,Oscar
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.,6,21,Michael
"He's got to go, Mike.",7,1,Darryl
I can't hear you.,3,18,Jim
"That's a good one. Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?",8,15,Jim
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.,2,2,Michael
"Wrong, for so many reasons.",8,11,Jim
"I don’t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone’s trust. About the pens.",9,11,Erin
You do that on TV!,8,7,Kevin
"My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? Excuse me, I've got work to do.",5,6,Dwight
Martinez.,1,2,Oscar
Well have fun with that.,4,1,Pam
"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.",5,3,Michael
Really?,5,25,Michael
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...,6,12,Dwight
"No, he's not.",3,4,Michael
"Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.",2,5,Michael
"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.",8,14,Jim
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.,7,6,Michael
You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.,5,19,Kevin
It's not my problem.,5,1,Angela
Woo! Ahh!!,9,1,Dwight
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?,8,6,Angela
What did you say?Pizza guy A loser.,4,3,Dwight
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.,6,12,Kevin
Wh-Why not?,4,4,Michael
What? Idiot.,8,4,Dwight
"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.",8,8,Jim
No! Don't!,7,17,Angela
I'm gonna help you through it all right?,6,5,Jim
"And, poof! He disappears.",9,15,Pam
"Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...",2,1,Michael
That's her?,6,22,Michael
Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,2,21,Pam
Yeah. Do you think she's hot?,8,7,Pam
"It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.",3,18,Jim
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,6,22,Pam
Mmmhmm.,4,6,Andy
"Uh, I have a pajama party. At the Playboy Mansion. With the bunnies.",2,7,Michael
"You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.",3,17,Michael
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,7,5,Pam
"Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?",9,6,Kevin
"No, it-",6,6,Jim
Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.,3,1,Pam
You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.,6,16,Jim
Meredith...  Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin!,5,19,Pam
Wow.,2,4,Jim
Okay.,6,12,Michael
No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He’s trying to steal it because he’s jealous of me.,8,8,Kevin
Really you do. I love the material.,3,6,Pam
I'm cool.,4,14,Michael
Can you believe that...,4,2,Pam
"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",2,11,Michael
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is How do we make this a better party?,8,14,Ryan
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.,9,22,Kevin
I'm not answering it.,5,17,Dwight
"Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!",7,19,Kevin
"There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.",8,3,Dwight
"Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?",2,14,Pam
"Hey, sport.",5,6,Michael
"Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?",7,9,Oscar
"Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.",3,15,Michael
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.,2,5,Michael
He just rolled out and crawled out.,8,9,Erin
"No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.",3,20,Jim
"Ok. Okay. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.",3,6,Michael
There's no theater in that.,7,13,Oscar
Here we go!,4,12,Michael
"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.",9,1,Andy
What is that? What is that?,5,13,Angela
"Yeah, I love it!",5,8,Pam
"Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.",3,17,Michael
"No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.",2,14,Michael
"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",6,4,Michael
I could give you some beginner stickies?,9,21,Pam
"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",2,14,Michael
"That's what I do, steal my trick.",5,14,Michael
"Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!",8,12,Kevin
"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.",2,3,Dwight
"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",6,5,Michael
Do you even know what that means?,6,15,Jim

It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.,7,19,Darryl
I do. But you married my worst enemy.,7,8,Dwight
"Wow, that's great, because I need paper.",5,6,Jim
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.,5,25,Michael
"Yeah, I guess, since I won.",5,9,Pam
"Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?",4,2,Pam
Yeah?,2,8,Michael
We should switch seats in order to...,2,5,Jim
"Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-",4,14,Dwight
You mad? You mad at me?,5,8,Michael
"It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.",6,4,Dwight
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!,9,10,Dwight
"It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.",9,20,Andy
"No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?Tall Girl #1 Call me.",4,11,Dwight
"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay.",6,3,Dwight
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.Officer 2 The neighbors said they heard some shouting.,4,9,Michael
"So, not prison.",3,9,Jim
"There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.",7,22,Jim
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.,6,17,Jim
"Okay, some for, some against.",6,21,Michael
"Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?",1,1,Michael
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.,7,12,Michael
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It’s going to be terrible.,9,1,Andy
What's the plan?,3,7,Dwight
You know what we need? We need some couches in here.,5,23,Michael
"That's the other thing you got to watch out...  Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.",3,8,Andy
"I don't, I don't have to have that.",6,5,Michael
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...,3,22,Michael
"Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.",3,15,Angela
"Yeah, but I'm number three.",3,10,Andy

"First item on the agenda can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don’t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.",8,1,Andy
Naked.,5,7,Andy
"You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake.",5,2,Jim
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.,1,5,Darryl
Closing time,8,6,Andy

I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.,7,9,Erin
Why don't you just have an apple?,4,7,Oscar
"I am, too. Let me show you.",6,10,Jim
"No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.",5,24,Michael
"I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.",8,16,Jim
"Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.",3,19,Michael
"Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.",4,1,Andy
"Andy, what time's the show?",7,3,Michael
"Wait, wait. Check one more time.",3,23,Michael
"Really funny, Michael!",3,8,Dwight
"Well, I work here now.",3,7,Jim
I put everything back in the vending machine.,7,23,Dwight
"When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office . Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy.",2,14,Michael
"Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",5,8,Jim
Hey! I can make that error.,8,11,Kevin
Wait til' Monday.,6,3,Kevin
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.,3,10,Michael
"Oh, that's good.",5,4,Jim
"Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.",8,23,Andy
These questions are bush league.,6,10,Oscar
"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.",9,7,Pam
Then I will write it down.,7,4,Andy
They have art classes?,3,9,Pam
You use your brain too much.,6,3,Michael
You're being a Thomas Oregon!,8,22,Andy
"Hey, Andy! Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.",4,4,Phyllis
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.,6,22,Pam
Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.,5,6,Pam
He is fiercely intelligent.,5,5,Angela

"Yep, super lucky.",7,17,Pam
"Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so...",3,4,Kevin
Ask him his name.,5,6,Michael
Did you really?,2,15,Jim

Forty-two.,3,19,Oscar
Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.,6,9,Kevin
"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.",6,9,Michael
"No, no, title change only.",2,6,Michael
Perfect.,2,3,Jim
Can I kiss you?,7,14,Michael
"No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.",5,1,Michael
"Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.",5,26,Pam
Hurts like hell.,4,10,Kevin
What size shoes are you guys?,5,20,Ryan
No! Really?,5,21,Dwight
Just hit me. You'll see.,2,6,Michael
"Yes, he is.",7,11,Angela
"Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?",2,9,Oscar
You suppose?,7,14,Oscar
"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",2,10,Michael
"Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.",3,8,Dwight
"Thank you, Sensei.",2,6,Dwight
"Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.",8,20,Phyllis
"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",7,6,Michael
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.,1,3,Kevin
This should've been up yesterday.,3,10,Angela
"That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?",2,11,Michael
"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",9,15,Dwight
I'll work on that-,2,8,Michael
Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?,7,10,Darryl
And this is Dunder-Mifflin.,3,12,Jim
"All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. Wow, that's a fast elevator.",2,5,Michael
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,2,19,Jim
This trip was longer than I thought.,5,5,Darryl
"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.",3,21,Pam
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.,5,6,Pam
"I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.",7,20,Erin
Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!,5,5,Kevin
Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.,5,13,Michael
19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,5,2,Jim
"Well, I think you look great.",2,22,Jim
Hello!,6,23,Michael
So did you hear?,3,2,Kevin
And in this case...,4,12,Jim
"No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.",3,19,Michael
"And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here. Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else? Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess. And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room . Ok, and uh, that's the tou-",2,9,Jim
"Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation’s Lisa Loeb.",9,19,Andy
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.,4,5,Pam
"Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!",3,22,Michael
"Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?",2,18,Dwight
She's pretty hot huh?  She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.,3,1,Andy
"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",1,3,Jim
"Night, Pam.",3,5,Kevin
The reverse cycling ends tonight!,7,8,Pam
"She doesn’t know. I shouldn’t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.",9,8,Oscar
Rut tit doh doh...,9,16,Andy
"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.",4,3,Michael
"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.",7,6,Andy
Michael. Sorry.,5,22,Dwight
"Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?",9,21,Andy
"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",5,25,Michael
"Okay, we can start. Um...",3,4,Michael
What about the Halloween party?,2,5,Angela
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.,2,15,Michael
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?,5,20,Michael
"Hey, sorry. I'm ready.",7,11,Pam
"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.",1,1,Michael
"Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.",6,2,Darryl
"Ok, let's try another one. Um...",3,18,Michael
"No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.",3,12,Michael
You didn’t force me.,9,22,Jim
I need help.,4,4,Dwight
"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?",7,10,Michael
"Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing Some people shouldn't be in this business.",6,18,Michael
"Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.",4,11,Ryan
No. I think you should date Kelly.,4,3,Dwight
"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...",3,4,Michael
Haha...,4,3,Jim
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.,8,20,Dwight
"We got to see Ping.  And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. Which for me, has ruined them for life.",2,1,Jim
"I insult you, Oscar.",9,4,Kevin
"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",7,11,Pam
"Uh yeah, look at that.",8,14,Andy
"So, how are you?",4,2,Ryan
"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...",8,11,Andy
Don't shave my lips.,7,19,Michael
Can you give us another minute please?,5,23,Pam
"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.",4,1,Dwight
You have till five.,2,21,Dwight
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!,4,14,Jim
"You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.",8,18,Darryl
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.,4,5,Andy
"Because he's mean. He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy. He talks about how gay Oscar is...",4,12,Michael
"You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.",9,19,Andy
"Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.",5,4,Dwight
"Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.",7,22,Jim
"Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.",2,1,Jim

Perfect!,8,9,Jim
"No, no. You're done.",5,23,Michael
Hey.Co-worker Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.,9,12,Jim
Is that ladle stainless or...,8,9,Phyllis
Are you wearing anything under the robe?,5,20,Pam
That's perfect.,3,4,Michael
We could be roommates.,8,16,Erin
"Troy, do you know anything about this?",4,14,Dwight
Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.,7,11,Pam
"Kelly, you’re here.",9,23,Ryan
Okay. Fine.,6,16,Dwight
"No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.",3,23,Angela
"That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!",2,18,Dwight
You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.,4,1,Dwight
Yow!,4,6,Dwight
Good one? That's a cool camera.,4,14,Jim
"I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.",4,11,Michael
Who is he saying?,2,5,Dwight
"Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?",6,12,Michael
"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",5,15,Jim
What's wrong? Where's your costume?,2,20,Michael
Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?,5,16,Oscar
"Boo, unimpressed. It’s a tightrope for babies. Boo!",9,1,Dwight
Yeah. I like talking to her too.,2,15,Jim
That's how devoted I am to this job.,3,20,Michael
That's what faggie means!,3,1,Michael
"I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share.  ""Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center."" Juvie. ""According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."" Blah, Blah, Blah.",5,14,Dwight
"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.",5,17,Jim
You don't work with us.,2,9,Dwight
"Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?",5,21,Jim
You are relieved.,4,7,Michael
I will have the gabba-gool.,6,5,Michael
"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",6,5,Dwight
"Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",3,21,Michael
Do you believe that?!,7,21,Phyllis
"Darryl, hey.",9,22,Pam
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?,6,4,Andy
I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes,9,7,Dwight
Please don't talk about my breast milk.,6,2,Pam
"Now, you listen to me, sir.",5,6,Jim
"It's all connected. Shut up. Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'A.J. No, what are you talking about?",5,15,Michael
"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.",7,17,Michael
Eat it.,7,12,Michael
"It did, it did.",8,14,Dwight
He's not saying what he needs to say.,5,13,Pam
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.,7,15,Darryl
"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?",7,24,Angela
"Well, I think I can get through the door.",7,14,Michael
"Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements.",2,21,Michael
"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.",8,12,Andy
Okay.,4,9,Michael
"Well, I'm not signing away my rights.",9,16,Andy
"It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.",4,6,Michael
But you're calling me a liar.,9,16,Andy
"I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",3,23,Dwight
Potential future nonsense.,9,22,Jim
"Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?",4,11,Ryan
I can see that happening.,7,17,Dwight
Leave the keys.,3,12,Dwight
Chiklis style.,5,24,Ryan
"Oh, ok. Alright.",2,16,Michael
Yes. What are my expectations for the group?,8,14,Dwight
"Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.",2,3,Dwight
Maybe it's what she does here...,8,14,Dwight
Who is he?,7,3,Erin
"No, don't. I'm mad at them.",5,2,Pam
"I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.",2,18,Michael
"Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog.",3,18,Darryl
It smells like cookies.,2,3,Kevin
For the bugs.,2,7,Pam
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,1,1,Jim
Who wants candy?,6,7,Michael
"Yes, absolutely.",3,23,Jim
Really?,2,14,Michael
"He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.",7,4,Michael
"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",6,11,Jim
"Um... Oh, Ryan, you’re so smart. You’re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.",8,17,Dwight
There's no way you're laughing at this.,5,6,Dwight
"She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.",8,22,Kevin
Oscar... can I ask you a question?,9,8,Angela
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.,5,12,Dwight
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.,9,18,Dwight
"We don’t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-",8,1,Jim
Vos!,9,3,Erin
Uhhgh.,5,8,Michael
"Oh, my God, I thought I was gonna pass out.",4,9,Pam
"And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.",8,17,Andy
"Yep, he's lying.",8,7,Dwight
"Cold, huh?",3,10,Phyllis
"Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",5,10,Michael
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,7,22,Pam
"I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday.",4,11,Pam
"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.",9,17,Pam
"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",2,12,Michael
"Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.",7,9,Ryan
"Yeah, I can make you a list.",8,23,Pam
What kind of toppings would you like?,7,21,Michael
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.,6,1,Oscar

Really? Is she OK?,3,21,Michael
"Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?",4,4,Michael
"When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.",3,10,Angela
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...,4,1,Michael
"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.",1,1,Michael

He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.,5,22,Michael

Sure. Uh huh.,5,17,Pam
"I like, uh...",4,14,Michael
Why do you hate her?,4,14,Michael
I think we'll be fine.,8,3,Dwight
"I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.",9,9,Oscar

Actually it sounds like you are.,4,3,Jim

I miss him.,5,6,Pam
"Yeah, go away.",7,4,Pam
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?,8,19,Jim

Very nice!,4,8,Michael

Michael is gone.,3,23,Dwight
"Allow me. You're going to love this. Ugh…should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.",8,6,Dwight
That's still a lot of money!,8,3,Phyllis
"Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.",5,2,Michael
"Hey la, hey la...",8,21,Erin

"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, ""this sounds really stupid.""",8,11,Andy
Right Dwight is loud.,5,6,Pam
All right. See you later. Ahh.,5,11,Michael
"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.",8,7,Dwight
"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",2,3,Michael
"Yeah, you left the price tag on.",2,10,Ryan
"I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I’m finished, it’s over.",9,7,Dwight
"Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.",7,11,Darryl
"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?",8,18,Phyllis
"You knew it the whole time, buddy.",5,6,Jim
Are you having a good time?,7,8,Erin
Do ya?,5,13,Jim
"Yes, after my grandfather.",8,4,Pam
"We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?",5,4,Michael

"Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.",3,15,Phyllis
I already made an appointment… with your secretary.Mr.,8,23,Dwight

"I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.",2,8,Jim

"Hey, Dwight. Michael and",2,14,Oscar
It's a man eating cat food.,4,12,Angela
Are you taking your med-meds?,8,9,Andy

"Carol, you're on with Michael.",2,22,Pam
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...,8,12,Dwight
"Yes. My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation. Very, very excited. He is my protege. He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured. Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk. And now he is also my boss. So, win/win.",4,2,Michael
If you lay a finger...,3,5,Michael
"No, no, not real bombs.",4,6,Michael
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.,8,16,Jim
C.C,7,14,Phyllis

"So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.",1,6,Jim
Stanley was on your group date?,6,1,Michael

"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",2,19,Michael
I'm Facebook.,7,9,Michael
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,6,5,Andy
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?,3,10,Michael
"Just do it, okay?",5,24,Michael
Yes.,2,5,Michael
"Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome. Mr.",9,18,Dwight
"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",8,9,Dwight
Well it can wait. It can wait.,6,22,Michael
Ah... I'm gonna s-,8,10,Jim
"Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise.",6,8,Michael
"Actually, it's just-",2,9,Oscar
"Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!",2,12,Michael
"Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?",4,2,Phyllis
I want you to get your ass out of my face.,5,1,Michael
"Hi, Kelly.",4,8,Pam
"I don't want to be like ""a guy"" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the ""crossword puzzle guy"". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the ""something guy"".",2,4,Ryan
"Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it",8,16,Dwight
And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?,5,6,Michael
"Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life.",3,14,Michael
"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.",8,12,Andy
"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.",5,12,Jim
What!?,6,16,Michael
"So, how you been?",3,23,Michael
"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...",2,1,Michael
Good.,6,19,Michael
Baby.,8,2,Pam
"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",6,20,Michael
Where'd he go?,4,4,Pam
When is the Paleolithic Age?,3,23,Dwight

Thanks for coming in guys.,8,2,Andy

That's a lot of reasons!,7,17,Jim
"...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.",8,5,Pam
Just steer more now.,7,5,Jim
"Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.",4,4,Dwight
"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. Can I tell you what else I learned?",5,6,Ryan
I need to see your pupils.  I need to see if they're dilated.,6,2,Dwight
Yes. Of course.,7,1,Dwight
You knew it.,5,6,Jim
Very good,3,23,Michael
"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.",4,12,Michael
"Morning, everyone.",8,17,Andy
"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",7,24,Jim
In a way it’s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they’ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I’ll have a grandson.,9,1,Dwight
"I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.",8,9,Jim
Yeah!,5,9,Michael
"Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.",4,10,Phyllis
Because he wasn't following the rules.,3,22,Michael
"Stop! Don't look at me. On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.",4,14,Dwight
Having fun?,2,11,Michael
"Oh, it was this summer –",8,23,Pam
Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?,7,8,Michael
Mmmhmmm.,2,2,Michael
What can I do better?,2,14,Dwight
I want you to rub butter on my foot.,2,12,Michael
A... S... S... H... E... T?,7,6,Erin
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.,2,10,Dwight
"Jim, come on.",8,18,Dwight
"So what is going on, girl in the computer?",5,1,Jim
"I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.",4,14,Michael
Which one is that again?,1,4,Michael
"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. Pam says hi. Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.",3,2,Michael
"How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?",3,11,Michael
Umm….,9,23,Jim
"You looked freaked, man. We said ""Surprise."" You were, like, ""What?"" ""What the hell's goin' on here?"" Good cake. Why don't you have some?",1,4,Michael
"Well, who can do a party of this size? But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses. Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR! Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry. Um, thanks for your time.  What? Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.",4,14,Phyllis
"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?",9,12,Dwight
"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",6,16,Jim
"Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.",2,11,Michael
"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.Pizza guy I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.",4,3,Michael
"Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.",7,11,Angela
"No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.",7,1,Andy
"Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.",3,1,Angela
How long till we get to Mexico?,7,7,Michael
Make him be quiet.,2,5,Dwight
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.,4,2,Ryan
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.,6,5,Dwight
"Hey, how'd the interview go?",9,16,Jim
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?,3,5,Jim
"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",6,23,Michael
Hey thanks. Thank you.,4,5,Michael
"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.",7,23,Dwight
Is it cool in here to you?,9,8,Angela

"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.Warehouse guy Little package! Little package!",2,2,Michael
"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you.",8,13,Dwight
On a Friday?,2,13,Michael
What's your win rate?,1,2,Dwight
"Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.",4,13,Dwight
What are... What are you doing?,3,4,Michael
That can't be right.,5,3,Phyllis
Love you.,2,11,Pam
That's what I'm saying! No of course not!,9,6,Dwight
"You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...",3,2,Michael
You aren't curious?,3,21,Kevin
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.,2,17,Michael
"You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?",8,12,Erin
"Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?",3,14,Michael
"OK, how is my voice now?",9,6,Dwight
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.,2,17,Michael
"I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?",2,4,Michael
"While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 400 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.",3,11,Dwight
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.,8,21,Erin
"Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... I'm making a sale. Sales.",6,18,Andy
"Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.",8,23,Dwight
"Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?",1,2,Dwight
Just pretend we're not here.,6,3,Michael
Michael you could put your initials in it.,4,12,Kevin
What's going on?,2,12,Jim
"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!",1,4,Michael
Mm-mm. Todd Packer.,2,14,Michael
"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",6,4,Michael

"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.",4,8,Michael
"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",6,22,Pam
It’s just one thing. Just let me—let me do this—,9,21,Dwight
"You don’t have to thank us for coming in, it’s our job.",8,2,Phyllis
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?,2,13,Dwight
"Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!",9,12,Angela
"Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady.  Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical.",5,2,Michael
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.,8,22,Andy
I'm telling Michael.,2,1,Phyllis
"Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.",7,6,Kevin
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.,5,17,Dwight
"Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...",8,24,Oscar
That's supposed to be confidential.,2,1,Oscar
My lord my liege.,4,1,Michael
"Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",2,6,Michael
"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",8,8,Andy
Are you being serious?,1,4,Pam
"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.",1,1,Michael
"Um... God, so many, Nellie!",8,22,Ryan
Here they come. Boom!,6,7,Kevin
"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?",4,8,Michael
"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.",5,20,Dwight
"It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.",5,1,Dwight
Cooper's.,5,22,Michael
And then if I want...,3,8,Dwight
"I'm good. Oh, my God.",6,23,Michael
What do you think?,3,15,Dwight
"I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?",9,18,Oscar
OK.,3,11,Michael
"I’m taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.",9,21,Jim
Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.,9,20,Angela
I guess we don’t have a choice.,9,12,Erin
"Oh, wow! What did you do?",5,25,Michael
"Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.",4,14,Kevin
Alright. Bye.,3,17,Michael
"Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. Listen to me, bragging away.",8,19,Erin
"Well, how about Thursday?",9,21,Erin
What about our truce?,5,22,Michael

"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",4,4,Michael
Ryan Howard. Ryan! Gold medal.,2,3,Jim
"Okay, forget it.",3,7,Phyllis
"It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.",7,19,Darryl
No.,7,7,Michael
"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?",1,4,Michael
"Oh, that's not appropriate.",1,1,Michael

We really did. It was fun.,4,4,Pam
We need to talk!,3,8,Dwight
"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.",3,4,Michael
"I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?",2,20,Michael
Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?,8,9,Phyllis
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.,4,3,Jim
"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",3,7,Michael
"The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.",3,20,Michael
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.,7,18,Dwight
"Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?",1,3,Dwight
"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",6,4,Dwight
"Excuse me, one second. Hi.",8,20,Jim
"I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.",3,5,Ryan

Wow. Did your baby draw that?,7,12,Dwight
That was fun.,6,24,Michael
I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.,7,12,Michael
"Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.Passer-by Okay.",7,10,Dwight

Everybody dance now…,9,11,Pam
"Totally, we should both work out.",3,19,Ryan
Uh...,4,3,Michael
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.,7,12,Dwight
Why would we-,5,15,Kevin
"I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-",5,4,Michael

Who is this?,5,14,Dwight
"Dwight, this is crazy.",2,1,Jim

The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?,6,7,Michael

Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.,7,21,Pam
"Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.",5,2,Michael
"Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.",7,3,Dwight
Don't Meredith.,3,16,Angela
I'll have Pam send out a memo.,2,6,Dwight
At least.,7,9,Michael
"Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...",4,14,Michael
"Ah, no, it passed. It's good.",6,16,Pam
I would love that.,5,23,Michael
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",9,18,Andy
We measured it once...,3,19,Dwight
I will seduce her.,5,12,Michael
Why do you want this cat?,9,1,Angela
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.,8,22,Ryan
You people. Come on. You're sleeping with me.,4,9,Dwight
That's not why you lost.,3,22,Dwight
It means grandmother.,5,20,Pam
I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.,3,18,Jim
"No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough.",5,16,Jim
"I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?",4,4,Oscar

"Oh, wow, that is adorable!",6,19,Michael
"Uh, yes, I am.",3,21,Michael
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?,3,1,Michael
"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",6,10,Jim
Y-You can-Michael.,4,14,Michael

"I know, it's very, very personal...",4,12,Michael
"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or…",9,23,Jim

That is weird.,2,6,Jim
How are we doing on contractions?,6,16,Jim
"Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. Oh.",3,23,Pam
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,6,3,Michael

""Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."" Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.",2,9,Michael
I don't think that's a good idea.,6,24,Pam
"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.",6,24,Jim
"Um, let's see... it's fine.",5,19,Phyllis
"I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. ""Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry."" Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.",4,9,Dwight
"Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",3,23,Dwight
You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?,5,2,Michael
"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself.",8,13,Dwight

Helene?,6,22,Michael
"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",3,4,Dwight
That's not it.,4,14,Jim
"Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.",5,21,Dwight
"He said, where is the bomb?",7,16,Michael
You are.,5,5,Michael
I wrote it out.,4,1,Angela
"Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",6,11,Dwight
Done. Explain.,9,1,Jim
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?,6,23,Michael
"Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models!",6,16,Michael
"Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?",8,4,Jim
Do you really mean that?,3,19,Michael
"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?",8,1,Andy
"I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.",8,6,Jim
"Ho hah!....oh, shoot.",8,13,Andy
"No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.",2,1,Pam
"Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -",6,13,Ryan
"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. Sorry. What's up?",3,2,Pam
That really works.,6,8,Andy
"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.",5,6,Pam
Having a great time.De,7,20,Jim
"No man, we are.",8,7,Darryl
"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",6,1,Jim
"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",5,4,Michael
"Meet my eye line, Jim!",3,8,Dwight
Drew. I'm Drew now.,3,19,Andy
Sorry.,2,1,Pam
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.,1,1,Michael
"You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.",6,23,Michael
"And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.",7,10,Pam
You should ask her out.,6,4,Dwight
"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.",4,4,Michael
I want the iPod.,2,10,Pam
"He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.",6,7,Erin
Back off me.,4,1,Kevin
"Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.",9,10,Erin
"Yeah, I know. I know.",6,21,Michael
Really?,2,8,Michael
"Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.",4,7,Michael
"Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.",2,5,Michael
"No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.",3,18,Michael
"Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?",6,16,Pam
All right.,5,9,Michael
"Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.",3,21,Dwight
"No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.",2,17,Michael
"No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?",7,4,Michael
Damn it!,8,15,Dwight
"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.",2,8,Dwight
I think I should call her.,5,17,Kevin
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?A.J.,5,15,Michael

"I don't care, that's how much I swear!",6,24,Andy
"Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?",9,7,Angela
"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.",3,18,Jim
No.,4,12,Michael
Nah. I like my plan better.,9,21,Andy
Basement office? You mean like a lair?,6,24,Dwight

"Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.",8,12,Ryan
"Hello, Rolando, how are you?",5,14,Michael
"If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.",3,2,Kevin
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.,9,23,Jim
"Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.",9,2,Erin
"Yeah, I know. Neiche!",7,3,Andy
"Grass, weed?",5,8,Michael
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.,4,1,Dwight
"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.",3,10,Pam
I was planning on it.,4,1,Pam
"So, he's alive.",8,18,Angela
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here’s something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive’ situation. No... that can’t be it.,8,1,Dwight
"This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.",9,10,Jim
I just need you to know-,8,20,Andy
Mmm-hmm.,2,3,Jim
"You know, it was one day.",2,21,Jim
Cell phone? Charger?,6,4,Dwight
"Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?",5,5,Andy
Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.,6,6,Dwight
We will discuss this later.,5,7,Angela
...which I guess I'll be taking.,2,14,Jim
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.,8,5,Jim
"You don't have to keep saying ""I do declare"". Any time you say something it means you are declaring.",6,9,Ryan
"Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.",6,14,Pam
You know I don't like to participate in the...,3,16,Oscar
For Pete's sake it just needs to be done!,7,17,Erin
"Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.",4,1,Michael

You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?,2,12,Jim
"Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?",9,9,Kevin

Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.,7,6,Oscar
She was stoned apparently.,4,10,Dwight
Did you just change it to Gollum?,1,4,Jim
I didn't have time because of my daughter.,8,3,Darryl
"Yeah, perfectly mediocre.",8,5,Dwight
"Okay, alright.",6,23,Michael
Absolutely not.,3,14,Jim
"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.",3,10,Dwight
You want to talk about it?,5,4,Phyllis
"Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, ""only the best and the brightest.""",4,13,Michael
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,2,5,Michael
"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",2,11,Michael
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.,7,20,Ryan
"No, no absolutely we are not doing this.",4,6,Jim
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?,2,3,Jim
"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.",1,2,Michael
"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",2,20,Michael
"A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?",3,19,Darryl

"Oh, that's my last one.",5,10,Dwight
You said you checked it.,7,7,Pam
No!,4,12,Michael
Excuse me.,4,3,Andy
"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?",3,2,Michael
How are you?,6,21,Jim
"I wasn’t fired. What are you talking about? I’m fired up, yes. Guys, I’m—I’m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.",9,21,Andy
"Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.",8,11,Jim
You a baby daddy?,5,3,Darryl
Oh. Thank God.,6,4,Michael
"No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh.",4,3,Dwight
Oh. Come on. Be serious.,3,18,Michael
"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.",4,5,Jim
"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.",3,8,Michael
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.,6,22,Darryl
Hi. Mmm. 'Cause--,5,1,Pam
Anyone else?,5,13,Dwight
"I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.",8,15,Dwight
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!,3,8,Michael
That sounds awesome!,9,3,Darryl
"Yeah, I figured that.",7,10,Michael
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!,8,8,Dwight
"Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.",9,10,Erin
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.,5,6,Dwight
"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...",5,13,Michael
Out.,8,8,Ryan
Maybe I do. Enough of your magical riddles!,4,14,Dwight
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.,9,3,Andy
"In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.",3,12,Andy
What? What I'm saying...,6,15,Michael
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,2,10,Pam
I want to hit you. I'll do that.,6,8,Pam
The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.,5,24,Angela
No you go. Hi honey!,9,18,Angela
"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",2,5,Michael
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,6,2,Dwight
He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling.,3,14,Ryan
"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",6,6,Jim
Guh.,2,9,Angela
Is there another option?,7,1,Michael
"Oh, okay.",2,22,Michael
"Right, yes.",7,10,Erin
"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.",2,12,Pam
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.,1,5,Jim
Whoa.,7,22,Kevin
"I've got a Madlib for you a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",4,12,Dwight
Leave the telescope.,7,18,Jim
"Sure, sweetie.",7,11,Darryl
"Jim, I am so fed.",4,14,Phyllis
I... am a hero!,3,16,Kevin
"Oh, all right! All right! All right! All right!",4,1,Michael
"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",6,15,Jim
Ha! Knew it!,6,19,Andy
Is he ok?,2,12,Pam
"I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.",3,23,Dwight
Line it up Phyllis.,4,5,Michael
Ok. Who reports to who?,3,8,Dwight
Oh! Goal!,5,20,Jim
I can sign for it.,2,19,Pam
"Kevin, where are you going?",9,22,Angela
"Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?",7,6,Oscar
"Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",6,16,Jim
"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",7,18,Michael
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!,9,18,Oscar
Oh no.,5,19,Pam
"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.",9,16,Pam
"Ooh, ooh!",8,21,Kevin
"Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, Boom.",5,21,Dwight
"Oh... Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.",3,7,Michael
"Oh, I’m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I’m not in your panties, I don’t go vigilantes. Why don’t you ask your husband?",9,8,Dwight
None of your business.,5,2,Dwight
What do you mean again?,7,4,Andy
"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.",4,1,Michael
Yeah. It's another note.,2,8,Ryan
Shower radio. Neat.,2,10,Oscar
No is not an option.,6,17,Michael
"Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.",9,11,Jim
What kinda iPhone is that?,8,6,Jim
"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I’m thinking of. Can you clarify that?",8,1,Andy
"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",3,7,Michael
"I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. That's Popeye.",3,23,Pam
"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.",9,15,Erin
That looks great.,5,24,Ryan
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.,4,4,Jim
Don't let us down.,7,5,Michael
Just like that.,4,9,Jim
"I color code all my info. I wrote ""gay son"" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means ""Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?"" Most colors mean ""Don't say it.""",5,22,Michael
"'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'",6,19,Erin
"Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...",2,20,Dwight
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.,4,1,Pam
"Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.",3,12,Jim
You're 54 years old.,6,8,Michael
"And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black.",6,21,Michael
"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",2,10,Jim
At least it's quiet.,5,5,Darryl
Whoops.,3,23,Jim
"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?",2,5,Michael
"Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",4,2,Michael
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?,5,14,Michael
"Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.",9,20,Andy
"I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?",8,3,Dwight
"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.",7,19,Michael
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",5,11,Michael
Stop talking all at once!,4,3,Michael
All right!,7,8,Michael
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.,6,17,Jim
"Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.",5,5,Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?",2,22,Michael
"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",9,16,Dwight
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.,2,14,Michael
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.,7,4,Michael
Walk with me.,5,11,Michael
This is Mr. Scott.,1,1,Pam
"Express love, magical.",7,4,Andy
"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",4,7,Dwight
"Thanks, Kev. I'm good though.",3,18,Jim
"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.",6,5,Andy
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?,4,3,Pam
Checks out.,2,13,Dwight
"There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.",3,22,Pam
"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",2,12,Michael
"Don't come in, I'm busy.",7,11,Darryl
Hey! We need to get you dressed!,5,20,Pam
No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!,7,23,Kevin
"Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.",5,6,Dwight
Yeah! Your idea.,6,11,Dwight
Really? I don't know.,3,3,Pam
Ooooh.,5,6,Andy
Legends of the Fall?,2,4,Pam
"Wrong. Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?",1,3,Dwight
"Exactly. Here, here are my sure things. I blindfold her. I take her to the Houdini Museum. She chains me up...",5,4,Michael
"Whoa hey, why not?",3,7,Dwight
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.,9,18,Dwight
That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.,9,2,Jim
"Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!",2,14,Michael
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.,8,21,Andy
"You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine.",9,4,Pam
I'm working on it Kev.,5,19,Pam
"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.",5,22,Dwight
Let’s just forget it. Forget it.,9,12,Dwight
Give me the phone.,2,14,Michael
"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.",7,2,Dwight
Go back to the monkey!,7,15,Dwight
Andrew… Baines… Bernard.,8,9,Andy
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.,4,3,Kevin
Megan Fox! Come on!,7,10,Andy
Hey.,5,18,Jim
Do you want some coffee?,2,5,Michael
"Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.",9,18,Oscar
Did somebody order a hooker over here?,6,21,Michael
"Buenos dias, Jaime.",6,21,Michael
"Okay, okay. Shh!",7,23,Dwight
"So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",3,4,Michael
"Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.",7,24,Darryl
"I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?",3,22,Pam
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.,3,9,Jim
"Yep, that, yeah.",5,16,Pam
That's really comfortable.,6,12,Kevin
"Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.",8,23,Dwight
".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.",2,10,Dwight
"No, nothing like that at all.",7,17,Michael
"I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.",2,4,Dwight
Ah.,3,2,Michael
"Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.",3,10,Ryan
"Yeah, good. Can we--- Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!",5,5,Andy
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.,4,9,Jim
"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",8,12,Andy
"Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.",3,23,Angela
"Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.",3,8,Michael
"Tell me if I'm smiling or not. Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?",1,4,Michael
"No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend! Blegh.",7,12,Michael
"Well, there's got to be an explanation.",5,6,Jim
Learn to cook for one!,7,12,Pam
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.,8,22,Jim
What are you reading?,2,18,Jim
"Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize.",6,20,Dwight
"News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.",8,16,Angela
He looks like your twin.,4,6,Dwight
Fifty-two reams!,4,3,Andy
What belt are they?,2,6,Dwight
I'm a little busy right now. Could you BlackBerry me a message?,4,2,Michael
"Very funny, Jim.",8,15,Dwight
"I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.",7,21,Michael
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?,7,18,Pam
"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",2,20,Michael
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.,4,3,Kevin
"Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.",7,24,Andy
I'm a huge fan.,3,2,Dwight
He says salvation. No last name.,8,23,Erin
"Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",3,9,Michael
"Thank you. I mean, I’ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh…",9,19,Dwight
"Wrap it up, Gabe.",7,14,Darryl
I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.,5,2,Michael
"Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.",7,3,Dwight
"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.",7,2,Jim
"There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.",7,23,Dwight
"Oh, no no.",3,5,Jim
What is going on?,2,3,Dwight
"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  He is very real.",2,9,Jim
We take separate cars.,2,3,Michael
No.,4,9,Michael
"No, that’s not—",9,21,Angela
Like in a cup?,2,20,Dwight
"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?Woman in line It'll just be a second.",6,10,Dwight
"And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.",7,19,Michael
"How are you, man?",3,8,Jim
"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",9,15,Jim
"Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.",3,10,Pam
"Ho-ho, man! Wow. Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--",5,24,Michael
What about music? Do you have any music?,3,20,Jim
"This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.",9,20,Andy
"Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?",7,3,Michael
"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.",7,17,Dwight
Baseball! Go talk to him.,6,23,Andy
"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie.",5,17,Jim
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---,3,18,Michael
"For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.",2,6,Dwight
No. I was clearing my throat.,9,12,Darryl
"Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little ""Good Will Hunting"" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.",2,15,Michael
No! I will... go.,2,18,Ryan
What's bad?,6,22,Andy
"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.",8,24,Andy
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.,5,4,Dwight
"Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.",6,16,Michael
"OK, great.",6,9,Jim
"Oh, good.",3,5,Jim
"To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.",9,10,Kevin
"No, I don’t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can’t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?",9,21,Oscar
I have.,5,13,Dwight
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!,3,22,Dwight
I love him.,9,21,Angela
Nope. Baskets have it.,7,23,Jim
Speak.,5,5,Michael
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.,9,1,Dwight
"""Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.""",5,5,Andy
"I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 500, check into a hotel at about 600 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.",9,9,Jim
"Okay, Ryan.",5,20,Michael
"But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",2,17,Michael
"This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.",6,9,Michael
The party starts in an hour.,4,3,Angela
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.,2,22,Darryl
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?,7,23,Oscar
Where do you want to go for dinner?,4,10,Jim
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,7,2,Dwight
"Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--",5,23,Jim
"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",1,1,Michael
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,4,5,Michael
"Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.",6,7,Erin
Here we go!,6,16,Michael
I know. I don't care.,3,8,Pam
Next on the list -- song parodies.,5,20,Pam
"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",1,4,Jim
"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",2,10,Michael
"Oh, my God! Wow.",3,20,Jim
Can you grow up?,6,17,Jim
Cranford? No. We will never watch that.,5,4,Jim
Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.,7,13,Michael
All right. So... I guess this is it.,8,18,Jim
"Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...",6,18,Phyllis
There is no shower.,8,9,Dwight
"Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure.",5,23,Dwight
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.,8,3,Kevin
"You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.",3,21,Dwight
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.,5,4,Michael
Hey! Welcome back!,2,14,Jim
"No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.",2,18,Dwight
"Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?",3,17,Jim
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,5,9,Pam
Do you mind? The men are talking.,9,11,Dwight
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.,5,20,Michael
"You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---",3,6,Michael
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.,8,3,Darryl
"Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed.",3,10,Jim
It is. Ok.,2,9,Michael
And the clown?,5,8,Pam
Whoa! What was that all about.,5,14,Jim
"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.",2,20,Dwight
On one condition. You...,1,5,Dwight
350 and one penny.,5,4,Michael
I've got this! Charge! Go! Go!,8,12,Erin
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,2,19,Ryan
Ugh! Ow.,8,20,Dwight
More universal.,7,5,Darryl
I'm going to say it anyway.,5,14,Pam
I'd like to lodge a complaint.,6,3,Dwight
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.,7,10,Darryl
Yeah.,2,16,Michael
"Awww, sorry. Did it break?",8,6,Jim
What about a gift basket full of cash?,4,2,Jim
It's the new guy.,3,3,Andy
"So listen, we have to really scuff this up.",7,17,Pam
"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.",3,5,Michael
"You know, get it right.",8,9,Darryl
"Hey, Ryan, are you ok?",3,5,Pam
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.,7,15,Michael
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!,8,9,Dwight
"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",8,13,Dwight
"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",6,3,Michael
"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?",4,9,Dwight
"Yeah, so, I’ll see you on the red carpet. See, that’s how it works.",9,21,Andy
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.,3,7,Phyllis
Hello.,6,10,Michael
"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.",8,6,Andy
Okay.,3,3,Michael
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...,4,10,Michael
"I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list.",5,1,Ryan
"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",6,3,Jim
"Alright. Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",4,7,Jim
For a rainy day.,5,15,Kevin
"Wait, shut up.",5,6,Dwight
"Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.",6,8,Dwight
Let's get to it.,9,16,Dwight
"Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?",5,12,Michael
Oh God. Come on!,5,11,Andy
"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",9,15,Dwight
Don't take it.,6,1,Jim
Of course. You're always working hard.,2,5,Michael
Because of the flowers.,7,22,Pam
No! It was like four years ago!,7,4,Michael
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.",8,11,Oscar
"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...",1,6,Michael
I'm almost done.,5,13,Kevin
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.,8,23,Andy
"That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.",6,24,Michael
I think that's the question that you had...,4,8,Jim
And over here..,7,18,Michael
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.,6,10,Michael
Addor!,9,3,Erin
"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying ""we."" You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.",5,5,Andy
Hey Pam.Pam Yeah?,7,10,Dwight
"Oh, God. Oh...",4,10,Michael
"What? Dwight, you can’t do that.",9,23,Pam
"Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.",3,21,Ryan
"Just, we'll just keep going.",5,1,Pam
"Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!",6,16,Pam
"Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.",4,4,Dwight
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.,5,8,Michael
"Can't we all get along? No, we can't. But here's the thing yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences? No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.",3,8,Michael
"No, no, ridiculous.",1,5,Michael
"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",6,22,Michael
Do you know the industry is in decline?,5,19,Jim
"Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert.",6,11,Andy
Come stay with me.,9,21,Oscar
Bring it on.,5,6,Dwight
"Hey, get off.",4,4,Darryl
Yes.,5,17,Michael
We should play it.,7,18,Darryl
"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.",4,10,Jim
"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture…",8,6,Andy
"I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.",7,7,Jim
He’s in the bathroom.,9,7,Erin
Yeah. We shoulda brought Andy. I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.,4,6,Dwight
There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!,7,8,Michael
"Split the difference. Hey... mint chocolate chip, please? Is Jim out there?",4,7,Michael
"Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.",6,12,Pam
But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.,9,5,Dwight
"Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!",5,1,Pam
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?,5,6,Dwight
How about for dating my mom?,6,8,Pam
Yup. Really great. When's she available?,6,16,Jim
"Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?",7,9,Dwight
"Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.",7,12,Pam
This is Michael.,4,3,Michael
"Okay, Okay. Um… so… this past year has been really great, and you’ve been great and I just… I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn’t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture… and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.",9,23,Pam
Coffee Jim.,7,10,Michael
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.,8,15,Dwight
I can't take it anymore.,5,11,Michael
Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman’s?,8,2,Pam
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.,2,17,Michael
"Sure. Kevin, please leave.",6,16,Michael
No.,2,2,Michael
Who's doing the presentations?,8,15,Dwight
Whoa! What's the situation?,3,19,Andy
"Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?",5,26,Jim
"Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?",9,16,Phyllis
"Dwight, what...",1,3,Pam
"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. ""Michael, buy a motorcycle."" So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.",4,14,Michael
Yeah! It's a Christmas miracle!,6,12,Michael
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?,4,6,Oscar
Pam is taller.,3,23,Kevin
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! Ow! Dammit!,5,6,Andy
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.,1,5,Jim
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.,8,17,Dwight
Not guy friends?,6,1,Andy
"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.",4,2,Michael
Don’t—don’t—Check-in guy Please don’t.,9,22,Andy
"Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.",7,4,Andy
It's terrible.,6,11,Pam
So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.,5,14,Jim
"At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best.",5,24,Kevin
"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.",6,5,Andy
"That's not a good idea, Michael.",5,13,Phyllis
Time's up!,9,4,Andy
"It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.",5,13,Michael
If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!,4,3,Dwight
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.,9,15,Pam
"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.",7,24,Pam
"Michael. Michael ,it's okay.",6,8,Pam
"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",3,8,Michael
"Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?",5,1,Michael
That's my dress.,3,15,Pam
She's foreign. I am--,5,7,Michael
"Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.",9,14,Oscar
False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!,6,9,Dwight
"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?",9,15,Oscar
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.,2,2,Michael
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.,8,18,Darryl
"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",3,9,Michael
"Andy, no.",4,4,Angela

"You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts.",2,9,Jim
"And uh, I'll look into those.Graphics guy You should.",4,13,Pam
"""Interviewer has suspect motives.""",5,5,Dwight
She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.,2,14,Dwight
"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...",2,2,Michael
"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.",5,3,Michael
That's not how that works.,6,4,Jim
Sponge.,7,12,Erin
"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",6,11,Andy
"I am well, sir, how are you?",7,19,Michael
Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.,4,3,Angela
"Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.",5,1,Jim
"I don't know. Just felt like taking it off. Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?",2,9,Michael
"I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. Hey, babe, how are you?",3,16,Pam
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.,5,25,Michael
"I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed",8,22,Dwight
That's very...,7,24,Jim
What a coincidence.,5,11,Andy
"Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.",7,10,Andy
"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",6,23,Michael
"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?",7,20,Michael
"Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.",3,3,Dwight
I don't need to tell you that.,5,24,Michael
Absolutely but not really.,2,6,Michael
"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",3,12,Andy
"No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.",6,11,Erin
"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -",7,23,Dwight
And what is that?,5,1,Michael
He used to fight dogs.,9,7,Dwight
"Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",6,8,Dwight
Your hand's in it.,5,3,Angela
"You and me, Michael. Yes!",2,10,Dwight
Our party is also starting now,3,10,Pam
"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.",1,5,Michael
I like to call this... the bumper test.,5,3,Dwight
You remember? Yes!,2,2,Darryl
"Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!",7,8,Michael
"Yeah, yeah.",1,1,Jim
You wanna make me happy? Huh?,8,3,Darryl
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about?,7,17,Jim
I'll just wave and introduce myself.,4,3,Michael
And I was thinking it’s only fair that you help make this decision since they’ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,9,13,Dwight
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.,3,21,Dwight
"No, but that would've been a really good idea.",8,13,Pam
"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",6,3,Michael
"Yeah, all the homies",2,1,Michael
That's my car.,3,3,Michael
"Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don’t want to meet that person.",9,21,Jim
"Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.",9,22,Dwight
"We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.",3,20,Michael
"Woah, woah Delivery man Phyllis Lapin.",2,16,Kevin
I think you don't know what you're saying.,6,14,Oscar
Six point five days.,5,7,Jim
Really?,3,22,Michael
It's the ladies' room.,2,1,Dwight
"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.",4,8,Michael
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.,5,12,Michael
Take a stand!,4,2,Dwight
Bathroom.,3,13,Michael
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.,3,18,Pam
Oh my. That is small.,6,7,Oscar
"Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.",1,6,Michael
"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.",5,24,Jim
No questions.,8,6,Dwight
OK. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.,8,18,Jim
"Thank you, Meredith.",6,3,Jim
"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.",8,17,Andy
I agree. He'd land on his feet.,2,5,Michael
I have needs.,5,7,Andy
"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",3,5,Pam
"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.",6,23,Michael
I'd be satisfied with eight.,8,10,Ryan
"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both.",6,2,Michael
"Right on, brotha. Wurddd.",9,3,Andy
How do you know that?,2,20,Dwight
Nn no.,8,6,Andy
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.,7,5,Michael
Yes! Phyllis!,9,9,Pam

"You’re not getting this, Peter.  Make it go wider... up!",9,8,Kevin
Mose!,4,14,Dwight
"Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.",3,3,Dwight
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. Oh. I fixed it.,8,18,Erin
I have nothing to do.,1,3,Jim
Dragging.,8,16,Jim
Hey hey!,3,2,Michael
"Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!Ex-client I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!",4,2,Dwight
"Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.",7,3,Pam
"...the ""Busiest Beaver"" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.",2,1,Michael
"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.",6,24,Jim
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.,9,22,Dwight
Yay!,9,8,Erin
"Yep. Acidic, all right.",9,17,Kevin
You're not stuck.,2,4,Pam
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,4,2,Dwight
Nice.,4,10,Kevin
I think you guys might have the wrong Office.,8,17,Andy
"No, Jim brings in money.",2,5,Michael
"Stanley, gotta play hurt.",1,5,Michael
"Please, stop.",9,6,Kevin
"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",6,18,Michael
"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.",7,23,Dwight
"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.",7,3,Andy
"No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.",7,7,Michael
"Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.Another guy Wait for me! Don't say anything to my parents.",7,7,Michael
We're behind.,7,8,Ryan
"Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about?  You look great. I can definitely see the difference.",5,1,Dwight
"...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.",2,8,Jim
Spamster!,2,14,Michael
"Toby, how do you propose that we-",9,18,Oscar
You’re a bad man Andy Bernard.,8,7,Darryl
"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",3,7,Jim
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.,6,5,Michael
"And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?",6,4,Jim
"Well I’ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn’t believe me, so I needed a little help.",9,22,Jim
"I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.",5,26,Pam
Alright. Well hey...,6,1,Andy
But the rattler's so scary.,5,25,Phyllis
Thornwood Wholesalers.,8,16,Andy
"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.",1,3,Dwight
"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. Man on phone Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? I hear panting.",5,17,Dwight
"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I’m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!",9,1,Dwight
"Okay, adjective...",4,12,Andy
"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.",1,2,Michael
I have a smudge on my forehead?,3,8,Dwight
"Oh, that's great news for your friend.",7,5,Phyllis
I'm just...,3,17,Dwight
Dwight?,6,11,Jim
"So far, these are my leads. A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher. It's a start.",4,10,Michael
"Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.",9,20,Darryl
"Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.",4,12,Kevin
"Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.",7,15,Erin
Whoo! We did it!,7,1,Andy
"Well, thanks for being a good friend.",9,13,Pam
I don't think... I love it!,3,10,Michael
I think I'll just take my chances.,4,2,Oscar
"Michael, how did it go?",6,21,Kevin
Yeah sorry everyone else didn’t come. I think they’re just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.,8,8,Jim
"OK, who's hungry No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.",3,22,Michael
Kind of in the middle of something here.,6,2,Michael
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.,6,24,Erin
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.,4,7,Pam
Bye.,9,12,Pam
What are you doing out here?,3,11,Pam
"No, you get outta here.",3,10,Michael
"Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.",9,14,Kevin
"No, it's not. Just shut up.",2,3,Michael
"I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation.  Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so...",5,8,Jim
"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",4,2,Michael
That's awesome. Where are you staying?,2,17,Pam
I don’t like your friend Trevor.,9,8,Angela
"Good, do you see what I'm saying?",5,22,Dwight
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it.,4,14,Ryan
"Hand me that water. I always say ""Beer me."" Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?",3,20,Andy
"Because you said ""do you wanna hang out""-",2,9,Jim
"So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.",5,16,Michael
"Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.",2,5,Michael
Him or me?,2,21,Dwight
Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.,4,4,Michael
"I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.",9,3,Pam
"Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.",3,8,Michael
Fair question.,5,1,Jim
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?,8,17,Dwight
That's enough.,5,11,Angela
And I won't.,5,24,Jim
"Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun?",2,9,Jim
How's this place treating you?,3,13,Michael
"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.",3,2,Jim
"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.",5,9,Jim
"Oh, man!",8,18,Dwight
Hey.,2,13,Jim
Hey guys. I’m an Oscar liar weiner.,8,5,Oscar
"All right, who’s next? Nellie?",9,1,Andy
"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means ""always be closing.""",5,13,Michael
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...,3,17,Michael
"... Dwight, they embarrassed us...",3,19,Michael
And do your worst.,4,13,Michael
Mmm.,7,10,Michael
Yes. I am an accountant.,8,8,Kevin
"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?",5,8,Andy
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.,3,10,Dwight
"Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.",7,15,Kevin
"Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!Kelly's",3,6,Michael
"Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.",8,12,Phyllis
More freedom fries.,3,2,Pam
"I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?",9,18,Pam
It's been opened.Ex-client Yeah it was mine!,4,2,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",2,8,Michael
"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.",3,2,Jim
"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",6,5,Dwight
"I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.",7,9,Michael
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?!,7,4,Andy
Pi...,7,15,Andy
"Dwight, get off me!",2,1,Pam
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.,6,21,Michael
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,5,17,Dwight
"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.",7,2,Pam
What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,6,4,Michael
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.,3,20,Michael
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.,7,2,Angela
You and Michael are always the life of the party!,7,8,Erin
"Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.",3,22,Ryan
That doesn't surprise me.,9,6,Angela
"Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here.  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.",5,16,Michael
Nature.,4,10,Pam
Yes. I don't know. Mmhmm.,8,5,Andy
"Why would that make me a pervert, I -",5,3,Andy
"What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?",8,3,Andy
Nothing.,1,1,Jim
That's good.,7,15,Michael
"They're not that bad still, babe.",6,16,Pam
"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",2,5,Michael
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.O',6,10,Michael
"I’m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?",9,21,Andy
Animalian?,2,16,Jim
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I’m gonna miss these guys.,9,22,Darryl
"I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, ""We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.""",2,22,Dwight
You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay.,9,8,Angela
Thank you.,9,12,Pam
"No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.",5,12,Michael
"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",3,1,Michael
"Its business, not personal.",5,12,Dwight
I'm in it to win.,5,20,Andy
We do a lot more than that.,3,20,Oscar
But I banked six weeks.,6,14,Oscar
"Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 1115, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...",2,8,Jim
"Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.",4,4,Michael
All right.,5,4,Michael
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.,8,24,Darryl
"As you can see, we did pretty well, so...",5,9,Oscar
"Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.",5,14,Dwight
"Michael, you're just her rebound!",6,6,Pam
"Now, this is the projection over three months?",5,23,Jim
"Hurry, please.",4,12,Michael
"Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,",3,5,Jim
PM.,3,5,Pam
I think I'd like to go home now.,5,10,Angela
"Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.",9,22,Kevin
Is somebody after you?,5,16,Dwight
Look at that form.,9,22,Jim
"Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.",8,17,Jim
"Hi, Angela.",3,13,Oscar
"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",6,17,Michael
Where?,7,1,Dwight
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.,9,22,Dwight
Pam?,7,1,Jim
"Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we’ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.",9,19,Dwight
"This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!",2,4,Dwight
How did it go?,2,8,Dwight
Let me think about it--,4,12,Andy
"Maybe, I'm a little tired.",3,16,Pam
Assistant Regional Manager.,7,24,Dwight
"I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.",8,22,Darryl
"Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.",6,4,Michael
"Packer, we accept.",9,17,Kevin
"Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?",9,7,Pam
"Oh, yikes.",7,18,Jim
They should not be in that room.,5,1,Dwight
Yes it is.,2,20,Michael
"Hey, okay.",2,22,Michael
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.,6,24,Dwight
I know. I know what to do.,2,3,Pam
I don’t know how else to tell you.,9,22,Jim
Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.,5,7,Michael
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!,3,16,Angela
Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.,8,18,Darryl
"Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?",7,4,Andy
"And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.",3,21,Angela
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..,8,14,Andy
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's. It's not far.,4,1,Angela
"Take that, kid.",8,17,Andy
Is this the tape of me falling?,6,7,Michael
I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.,2,12,Michael
I'm just making conversation.,7,16,Pam
"I'm the same age as you, Michael.",2,2,Phyllis
Hey Michael. This ain't over.,2,15,Darryl
Q.,6,1,Kevin

Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.,7,16,Michael
"Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... So that's the way it's done.",1,1,Michael
"Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.",7,21,Phyllis
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.,6,6,Oscar
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.,2,17,Jim
"Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers.",5,1,Michael
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?,5,5,Jim
Who is the gal in question?,5,12,Andy
Ok.,2,6,Michael
"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",7,7,Michael
Is this allowed?,6,4,Jim
"Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.",9,15,Phyllis
"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.",3,9,Michael
Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.,7,20,Michael
I... this is Creed.,2,5,Michael
"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...",6,24,Andy
"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.",4,12,Andy
"Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.",6,16,Pam
What are you talking about?,3,13,Jim
Hed. Hedded,5,13,Michael

"Dwight says ""Hi.""",5,1,Jim
"NEVER! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",7,6,Michael
What do you know?,3,17,Dwight
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,6,5,Dwight
"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.",4,6,Jim
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.,3,23,Dwight
"No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.",7,7,Michael
Switch the computers back Andy.,7,17,Pam
Bye. Call me when you land.,8,14,Pam

I am fine.,2,1,Pam
"Alright. Well, Thank you.",2,20,Michael
"It's 430 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.",5,23,Michael
"Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.",6,11,Michael
"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.",8,10,Dwight
Who's ready to work?,3,23,Dwight
Kelly is the only applicant.,6,21,Dwight
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.,8,3,Oscar
um… I mean-,8,16,Jim
Cow surfing?,5,5,Michael
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.,9,21,Erin
No – just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.,8,5,Erin
"Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.",5,11,Dwight
Oh. I really thought I didn't get it.,5,24,Pam
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.,9,18,Angela
This party is going to be awesome.,3,2,Dwight
What is wrong with me today?!,1,5,Michael
"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick.",4,2,Dwight
Let me think about it--,4,12,Andy
"Ah, fine.",3,19,Michael
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,3,8,Michael
I don't think so.,5,16,Oscar
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...,6,21,Michael
"He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.",3,17,Pam
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!,6,12,Dwight
I can't go back to that.,4,4,Michael
"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.",7,11,Michael
Five years old?,5,18,Michael
Call it. CPR,5,13,Kevin
No. Absolutely not.,5,18,Michael
"If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",2,6,Michael
Dammit Dwight!,8,3,Jim
I’ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm….,8,2,Andy
"Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?",3,17,Ryan
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?,8,13,Andy
"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.",2,7,Oscar
"Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-",7,5,Jim
I can't hear anything!,5,3,Pam
"Oscar, do you want to be my partner?",9,10,Angela
Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?,3,10,Pam
"Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?",4,9,Michael
"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.",2,7,Jim
...noooo,3,3,Pam
"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",2,20,Michael
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?,2,9,Pam
"No, best thing that ever happened to me.",8,22,Andy
Love.,9,22,Jim
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?,4,1,Angela
Thanks.,9,20,Jim
Why are you dressed like that?,4,13,Michael
Totally... not.,6,9,Andy
"Ok, I’ve got my—",9,22,Oscar
Come on old lady. Let's go.,7,4,Dwight
"Our ultra feast menu's theme Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?",6,16,Kevin
"I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.Pam's mom Oh that sounds awful.",6,4,Michael
"Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -",3,11,Michael
Where?,4,1,Dwight
"It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.",6,8,Michael
"Blood, urine, or semen.",3,2,Dwight
Thank you everybody.,4,2,Ryan
Tuna... You're completely sane.,7,24,Andy
"What's up, Hef?",2,5,Jim
"Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!",5,6,Andy
"Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.",4,12,Pam
Pull over!,9,22,Dwight
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.,7,14,Phyllis
Look up here!,5,3,Andy
"Oh, okay. I don’t want any part of this.",8,1,Andy
"No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.",3,21,Jim
They're cool.,2,18,Michael
I love to watch him dance.,6,7,Pam
Thanks.,4,11,Jim
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,6,5,Dwight
"Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.",2,19,Jim
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.,4,11,Dwight
That was one time-,8,20,Jim
"Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.",3,21,Pam
"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.  Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar.",5,16,Michael
"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",2,11,Michael
"Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!",9,9,Dwight
"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.",8,13,Jim
Can't believe no ones thought of that.,5,10,Jim
Yes.,3,10,Michael
"Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.",6,21,Oscar
"Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.",6,16,Jim
"Uh, hit and run.",8,13,Jim
No.,2,22,Michael
That? In the conference room?,4,12,Michael
"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",6,3,Jim
"Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.",8,7,Darryl
"I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.",3,2,Michael
Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?,6,16,Michael
I'm really too tired to do this.,6,23,Jim
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.,6,7,Jim
What did you do to it?,2,3,Dwight
And how are you on this fine-,9,16,Andy
The sales department smashed my sandwich.,6,18,Michael
Have you seen Erin?,8,17,Dwight
Spot on.,3,20,Jim
"No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.",5,7,Michael
"Let me be clear. There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship. Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating. Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford. Mistress Lila. Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.",3,21,Andy
"Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",5,22,Jim
Okay. See you guys.,8,1,Jim
"Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.",6,1,Erin
"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don’t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I’m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.",8,1,Andy
"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you’d improve. No wonder women despise you.",9,11,Dwight
"Oh, God.",5,16,Michael
Funny Jim. That is funny.,7,10,Oscar
Thank you so much.,8,9,Dwight
It's Christmas Toby.,3,10,Dwight
"OK, I'm going back to work.",6,9,Jim
"Okay, listen.",5,11,Jim
Jerry.,6,14,Jim
Yes.,2,21,Michael
"Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.",6,6,Michael
"Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.",6,14,Jim
No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.,5,20,Pam
"Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?",4,4,Ryan
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!,2,17,Dwight
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?,4,5,Michael
"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.",2,16,Dwight
Oh! There we go! Pam?,8,15,Andy
"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",7,23,Jim
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.,5,16,Phyllis
"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.",4,2,Michael
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?,7,14,Dwight
"Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, ""Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.""",1,4,Michael
"I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.",5,18,Michael
That sounds like it was hilarious.,6,9,Michael
"Let me smell. Good, not great.",3,17,Dwight
"Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.",3,18,Jim
"Yeah, yeah, no, no. It’s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can’t do if you just keep singing ‘Monster Mash.’",9,5,Pam
"Everybody, except Stanley.",4,12,Michael
No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.,6,9,Kevin
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.,3,15,Michael
Hmm.,2,18,Pam
"Yes, it's mine.Police Officer 2 Some basil. Salad dressing, I think.Police Officer 1 Salad dressing?Police Officer 2 Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad. There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.",5,8,Michael
Ghaaa!,3,19,Dwight
"And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.",4,14,Jim
You can't tantalize me.,8,14,Dwight
"Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?",1,6,Michael
You don't want me to help?,4,2,Michael
Ryan? A little help?,8,1,Jim
"Uh, yeah, sure.",6,19,Michael
"Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.",2,16,Dwight
"Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?",8,5,Angela
"Can't talk, saving the planet.",7,9,Michael
I want to see it.,5,17,Michael
"It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",3,18,Michael
Michael.,5,23,Pam
Okay. The annex it is. I’ll be sitting at your desk if that’s okay with you.,9,21,Jim
"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",4,2,Michael
"Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?",5,14,Andy
"Cathy, go.",8,16,Jim
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.,8,15,Dwight
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.,3,3,Michael
"Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!",9,5,Dwight
Are people watching?,5,19,Michael
"Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.",4,9,Jim
What are you looking for? You bring dip?,3,17,Michael
"The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?",4,4,Kevin
Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.,5,23,Michael
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.,5,2,Michael
And wake up in the future.,6,23,Dwight
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. De,7,20,Michael
That's on a need-to-know basis.,7,23,Dwight
That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.,5,2,Angela
"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.",3,9,Michael
"When's the last time you upgraded your printer?D ""- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-""",6,17,Jim
Okay.,2,18,Michael
It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.,3,19,Dwight
I will open the door.,4,3,Michael
That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.,5,10,Phyllis
"Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...",5,14,Michael
Nice!,9,7,Kevin
"It is right. I mean, it's impossible.",7,18,Jim
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.,3,15,Phyllis
"Dwight, am I hot right now?",8,7,Pam
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,3,5,Pam
"They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.",3,19,Michael
"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?",9,10,Jim
I think they were just having fun.,3,22,Pam
"What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!",9,3,Jim
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,1,1,Pam
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.,8,3,Darryl
"I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.",8,16,Ryan
"I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.",5,14,Michael
So you like her?,6,19,Jim
How is everything? How's your car?,8,12,Erin
"How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.",3,8,Michael
"Yeah, she just went down.",8,4,Pam
Thank you. You remember Ryan And Pam is around here somewhere.,5,21,Michael
God. She left this here?,6,21,Michael
"The Jamaicans don't have a word for ""impossible.""",3,11,Michael
Oh shoot.,5,12,Michael
"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.",7,11,Pam
I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.,3,10,Michael
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.,7,15,Andy
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.,7,6,Dwight
"Ok, we ready? Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",9,16,Andy
"Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.",9,9,Erin
"Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.",1,4,Jim
"Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.",3,10,Andy
"No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.",6,24,Kevin
"Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...",8,3,Jim
"Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?",3,7,Angela
"What'd you have, Stanley?",5,24,Michael
"Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.",6,23,Michael
Well I'll do you one better.,8,10,Andy
Cancel. We're canceling it.,7,11,Michael
"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",4,2,Michael
When are you ever responsible for your actions?,5,22,Pam
Sorry Phyllis.,1,5,Michael
"Now, listen,...",7,24,Dwight
"Okay, just talk.",9,23,Jim
Was there a fistfight?,6,23,Phyllis
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.,1,4,Pam
Where do you wanna go?,3,10,Michael
"Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.",8,19,Erin
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!,2,12,Ryan
"Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.",8,8,Andy
It's not effeminate. It's festive.,5,15,Dwight
Finally.,5,22,Ryan
That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!,3,3,Dwight
"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",2,10,Michael
"Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.",3,10,Ryan
My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,5,17,Michael
"If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.",5,25,Pam
Good morning.,5,14,Pam
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.,4,1,Jim
"Good, we have a deal?",8,23,Dwight
Got it.,7,23,Dwight
"What do I do with my bonus check? Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.",5,6,Dwight
"So, we should let him go.",4,3,Jim
"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",6,11,Dwight
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.,9,19,Jim
"Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.",6,3,Kevin
"That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",3,12,Andy
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?,2,4,Dwight
"I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.",8,4,Darryl
"Ooh, I haven’t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?",9,12,Kevin
"We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.",6,12,Jim
All right.,3,7,Michael
"One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.",2,9,Michael
"No, constantly. Like, for years.",3,19,Kevin
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.,2,18,Pam
No. I'm on a sale!,7,21,Phyllis
I want some of those pills.,9,5,Dwight
Don't bother Luke.,7,1,Michael
"Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board.",7,12,Pam
"Well, it does. That's me.",5,3,Angela
"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He ""liked"" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.",7,24,Ryan
It smelled terrible.,2,14,Kevin
Then forget I just told you that.,9,1,Andy
Have we heard of it?,7,11,Andy
You can't call a meeting. But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.,8,21,Andy
"Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---",2,18,Pam
alright. See you there.,6,8,Ryan
"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!",3,4,Michael
"No, you shut up.",6,19,Michael
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.,6,16,Dwight
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.,7,24,Oscar
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!,6,2,Dwight
"Great, thanks.",1,5,Jim
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,2,15,Michael
"Oh, wow.",4,14,Michael
Okay. I won't let you down.,7,9,Ryan
"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground . All right.",5,9,Pam
No one wants to pick me up!?,2,12,Michael
That's not what I meant.,6,3,Jim
"No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.",1,6,Ryan
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet….the Pyramid.,8,2,Dwight
Really? What's going on?,6,12,Michael
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.,7,10,Michael
"Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?",8,12,Darryl
"I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.",8,20,Erin
"You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.",8,17,Dwight
Do you want to keep this?,7,12,Erin
No.Pam's,2,2,Pam
"If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?",7,5,Darryl
I am dying to know what's in there.,8,18,Oscar
Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.,6,16,Angela
Mm-hmm.,5,22,Pam
"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.",7,11,Andy
"Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a “we're just friends” beanie or a “I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'” beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.",8,14,Darryl
"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.",6,21,Dwight
"Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!",8,22,Kevin
Theme song from Saved by the Bell.,9,22,Pam
"Oh, just...",6,24,Dwight
"Uh, I'll drive.",2,7,Michael
"Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.",6,8,Michael
"I don't deserve this, guys.",6,6,Michael
Spinning would be more fun.,9,2,Jim
Who are you calling?,3,10,Dwight
"Well, it sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?",7,11,Ryan
Okay. Go Ahead.,7,9,Pam
"Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.",7,20,Ryan
"I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.",6,7,Michael
"""Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.""",8,20,Jim
"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official.",4,2,Pam
No. Can't let you do that Mike.,7,21,Darryl
Hey.,6,16,Jim
Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.,4,1,Michael
Yeah. Way too much.,6,7,Pam
You’re not going to take it?,8,7,Erin
Are you ready?,7,3,Andy
The professors would go to the parties?,2,9,Pam
"We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.",5,5,Michael
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.,3,6,Michael
"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",2,10,Dwight
"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.",3,11,Michael
"Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won’t forgive. So, hi.",9,22,Angela
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?,5,7,Andy
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?,3,22,Michael
It's gonna be fun.,2,5,Michael
"No, it is here.",3,17,Kevin
Yes.,6,8,Michael
"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",5,8,Michael
"That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.De",7,20,Michael
"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",4,2,Michael
"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",3,2,Michael
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?,9,22,Dwight
About talking to the press?,6,24,Michael
"Try and hide it, I will track this party down!",7,8,Andy
She has a boyfriend.,5,15,Michael
"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.",7,15,Michael
"Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.",6,19,Angela
"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.",9,10,Pam
What a night.,2,11,Jim
Oh...,3,23,Jim
"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",4,10,Michael
We should come up with a signal of some sort.,2,7,Michael
I don't know.  Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,3,23,Michael
"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn’t the fact that I’m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!",8,1,Ryan
I just knew.,4,14,Pam
Friends fight. Friends fight.,7,6,Michael
"Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?",6,15,Erin
I just... it's terrifying.,7,18,Michael
"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",4,12,Michael
"Go, go, go, go, go!!",5,13,Andy
"No, that's Afghan.",2,22,Pam
"Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.",6,24,Michael
Woooah! Wow!,4,2,Michael
Holdin' down the fort.,5,25,Michael
We are a family.,7,18,Pam
And he’s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it’s Hot Yoga with Blake.,9,7,Angela
"Nice job, man.",9,14,Jim
"I do, too. I do, too.",2,9,Michael
"Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?",9,6,Pam

"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.",4,13,Michael
I love it. And it’s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.,9,23,Darryl

"It’s only 600. Come on, everybody’s going.",9,23,Andy
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.,7,6,Oscar
"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day.

"Six of one, really.",4,1,Jim

America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.",3,22,Michael
That’s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.,8,9,Dwight
You're welcome.,5,4,Michael
"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.",8,18,Jim

Out of the way! Move it or lose it!,5,25,Dwight

Everything's a joke.,8,16,Dwight

"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will ""do"" you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",4,13,Michael

"Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?",3,14,Michael
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.Mark Mc,9,22,Andy
It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.,4,14,Michael
I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.,5,4,Jim

"No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.",3,10,Michael
"...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.",7,19,Andy
All right? I’m gonna wait.,9,21,Jim
You’ve got this Schrute.,9,7,Pam
Why don't we head in your office to talk?,6,2,Jim
What were you talking about in there?,6,6,Dwight
"Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.",1,5,Michael
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?",3,13,Michael
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?,6,10,Ryan

"Party central! So, what can I do you for? All right.",3,2,Michael
Phyllis? Could you take-.,5,3,Michael
"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",7,17,Pam
That was definitely not dancing.,2,14,Darryl
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,1,1,Dwight
"Ok, wait, so that would make me like right here.",2,9,Pam
"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.",9,16,Dwight

"Michael, are you having money problems?",4,4,Oscar
"I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?",8,3,Darryl
Great work tonight.,2,1,Michael
"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, ""Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, ""Super Duper Paper. It's super duper."" I don't know, something like that.",3,23,Michael
Got 'em. Go!,8,5,Dwight
"Dwight, come back and spot me.",8,9,Darryl
"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.",3,10,Michael
"Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.",3,23,Dwight

Um... Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.,3,12,Ryan
"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",6,20,Andy
"Hey, Mema.",6,4,Pam
"Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",5,10,Michael
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.,2,3,Michael

Good afternoon.,6,16,Angela

What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,3,7,Michael
You don’t have to say it if you’re doing it.,8,9,Darryl
Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.,3,19,Michael

It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.,5,13,Phyllis

I don't need your permission.,1,1,Michael
We're good to goooo!,8,16,Pam
You're not going to freak out?,1,6,Jim
You're going to be alright,8,22,Erin
That’s why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They’re not going to know what hit them.,8,9,Ryan
"Get up, get up.",2,12,Pam
But there is a reason why I'm here!,6,3,Jim
Come on!,8,3,Dwight

Nothing. Cocoa.,6,7,Michael

Close it.,7,18,Andy
"Oh, thank you my dear.",5,9,Michael
"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.",6,16,Pam
We are going to have two men's rooms.,2,1,Dwight
"Aye aye, Captain.",2,11,Dwight
No? Nothin'?,7,5,Jim
"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.",8,3,Jim
I guess I will swallow my truth.,9,20,Jim
Mpfh.,5,12,Michael
Trust me it would only make you mad.,6,6,Andy
"Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-",8,24,Oscar
"What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",6,4,Michael
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',5,17,Michael
"Huh? Yeah, see ya. Oh! What?!",9,18,Andy
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.,2,1,Phyllis
I don’t get it.,9,12,Kevin
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.,9,3,Andy
I know! It’s alphabetical.,8,1,Kevin
"Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.",7,13,Michael
"So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, ""What's going on?"" Well, you're not alone.",6,14,Jim
"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",4,6,Michael
You have an address yet in Colorado?,7,21,Oscar
"Good, how are you?",2,4,Jim
This is a bus transfer.,9,13,Dwight
Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.,5,16,Pam
I missed you.,5,7,Jim
"Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.",6,19,Pam
"Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?",2,18,Dwight
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.,7,18,Pam
I do not have a knife!,3,11,Dwight
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?,6,4,Dwight
"Oh, really? Ok.",5,25,Michael
Ha. The other guys can go die.,6,23,Andy
You didn't know it was my birthday.,2,19,Michael
We don’t get along.,9,11,Dwight
It's like a pay decrease.,1,3,Oscar
"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...",7,17,Michael
Screw ‘em.,8,23,Jim
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?,6,12,Michael
"Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.",6,7,Michael
No. What?,8,12,Andy
"Okay, thank you.",7,7,Pam
"Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?",8,3,Andy
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,2,20,Jim
Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.,1,6,Michael
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.,2,1,Darryl
Big Red Paper Company?Mr.,8,23,Jim
"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",2,10,Jim
I'm telling you to back down.,5,11,Andy
"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.",3,10,Dwight
You called the meeting I don't..,7,18,Pam
I’m sure you did not. What was your question?,9,21,Jim
"Wow, thirteen!",5,11,Phyllis
Say it with an accent!De,7,20,Michael
"Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. No, slide--- slide it, yes.",3,18,Michael
"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.",3,5,Andy
"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",3,8,Michael
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.,7,21,Jim
"Snap, for real?",7,22,Darryl
"Sweetheart. Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.",5,1,Andy
You're wearing a woman's suit?,3,18,Kevin
Oh—gee—I’m—,9,3,Pam
Okay.,2,20,Michael
"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",2,10,Michael
Very good Michael. Really good.,3,8,Dwight
They happened to speak Spanish.,4,11,Oscar
"I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...",6,6,Michael
"Oh, what are you usually?",6,3,Michael
You did approve it?,7,17,Jim
"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, ""Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.",1,3,Michael
"In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?",6,7,Andy
Why no kids?,6,17,Ryan
John Stamos.,9,2,Jim
"If I am not Boner Champ, I don’t know who I am.",9,5,Andy
"What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?",8,10,Dwight
Sha-bow.,6,7,Andy
This is Dwight.,4,14,Jim
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,6,10,Michael
"Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.",9,18,Jim
What?,5,16,Michael
What college did you go to Mike?,4,13,Darryl
"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",6,14,Michael
"Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... eleven dollars.",3,20,Jim
"You really have to say ""oh yeah"" every time you eat a candy bar?",8,11,Oscar
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?,4,3,Jim
"You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.",7,14,Jim
"The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.",5,6,Jim
"Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. Co-worker #2 Uh sure. No problem.",9,12,Jim
That's not okay.,7,24,Jim
Ugh. Eww!,8,21,Angela
"It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.",2,22,Jim
"Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?",2,13,Michael
"You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do? What can I do?",3,3,Dwight
"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",2,15,Michael
You're too heavy!,5,13,Oscar
"Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.",7,11,Kevin
"Hey, man. It’s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don’t. I’m in. Yeah, yep, I’m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!",9,1,Jim
Ow! What are you doing?,4,3,Angela
"I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the ""Don't Go in There After Me"" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...",2,1,Michael
"And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.",2,17,Dwight
"Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.",8,16,Dwight
What is wrong with you?,5,7,Andy
"Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.",3,22,Jim
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?,4,4,Dwight
"Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.Mary-",2,9,Michael
"You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!",7,20,Michael
Do I have any say in this?!,7,17,Jim
All right.,3,11,Michael
Who is that?,9,17,Oscar
"Meredith, I am so sorry about today.",9,10,Pam
That's a guarantee.,7,18,Jim
"I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.",9,18,Angela
Pam? Get us back into it.,2,4,Jim
It's disgusting!,6,20,Pam
"Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-",6,5,Jim
"I’ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here’s where we stand with the chore wheel. We’ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it’s more fun this way.",9,2,Pam
Right?,9,9,Jim
"Spot a cow, last person to say ""Jackson Five"" has to get on its back and ride it.",5,5,Darryl
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.,8,13,Oscar
"What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.",9,9,Dwight
They're our largest client.,5,17,Oscar
"This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.",3,21,Michael
"Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.",8,18,Erin
"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",2,11,Michael
Yes! We did it!,9,11,Dwight
"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",7,5,Michael
No need we can just check the security tapes.,4,1,Dwight
"Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.",9,5,Erin
"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.",2,7,Michael
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?,8,13,Darryl
"You know what they say, keep your friends close.",5,20,Michael
"Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.",8,14,Erin
I think you're under-thinking it.,4,3,Jim
Ooohhh...  Oh man! You okay?,6,2,Dwight
"No, a new copier! Unless everybody can agree on something better?",5,9,Michael
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,6,4,Dwight
It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.,6,15,Andy
Okay.,3,1,Michael
"Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?",7,8,Michael
"I was talking like this. I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.",7,23,Darryl
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.,2,18,Kevin
Next suggestion.,2,8,Dwight
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.,9,23,Andy
"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",2,13,Jim
"If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.",2,6,Michael
"Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.",8,22,Jim
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?,4,14,Ryan
"Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.",1,5,Michael
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! Sorry.,2,15,Dwight
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I’ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.,9,7,Dwight
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...,8,6,Dwight
"I mean, it's just that- You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...",4,6,Jim
Might've done. And how… do you figure?,9,3,Andy
Why Jim?,8,20,Dwight
"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him.",4,2,Dwight
It’s the second easiest job in the world. Being a mom.,8,9,Dwight
"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.",1,1,Dwight
"Of course you found him not guilty. ""Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.""",8,13,Dwight
"So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...",3,9,Andy
"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.",3,22,Pam
"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...",5,22,Michael
I called you morons.,3,20,Angela
"Eh, I've been sitting all day.",5,1,Dwight
Competent.,9,6,Jim
Not occasionally. All the time.,7,15,Oscar
"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",2,10,Jim
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?,5,19,Pam
"Oh, I put those up.",8,5,Erin
"Sorry! Bye, Andy!",3,22,Angela
"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.",8,14,Jim
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.,6,4,Angela
You are? What bar?,7,19,Michael
"Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.",5,4,Michael
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.,5,15,Michael
Must be hackers.,6,11,Michael
Pam?,3,5,Jim
Don't talk-,2,1,Michael
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.,8,6,Dwight
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.,3,23,Jim
"Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.",2,3,Dwight
"Yep, that's the Dwight I need.",8,7,Pam
Yes I do.,7,14,Michael
I don't know what they're made of.,6,14,Michael
"Dude, you're on TV! You’re the sportscaster on channel seven.",8,7,Kevin
"Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!",3,3,Dwight
"I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.",7,10,Michael
He did pick a good one.,1,6,Jim
That's right!,7,9,Michael
"Oh, okay.",7,20,Michael
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.,3,6,Michael
"Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.",4,6,Michael
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.,4,11,Ryan
Want some company?,7,12,Erin
"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.",6,23,Andy
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?,4,11,Dwight
The fire guy! The fire guy!,2,4,Dwight
You remember my cousin Mose.,7,2,Dwight
Make it go taller.,9,8,Kevin
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?,7,8,Michael
I'll just stand here?,8,24,Pam
"No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.",5,16,Michael
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse.,9,6,Angela
"The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.",5,6,Dwight
"I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.",7,14,Michael
One day for what?,3,20,Pam
"I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?",8,13,Phyllis
You got a fax.,1,1,Pam
Why?,5,4,Michael
That is so badass. So hardcore.,7,19,Ryan
"The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with.",5,24,Michael
And a shower.,7,15,Jim
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?,5,21,Pam
No you don't.,8,21,Ryan
Is that okay?,2,17,Pam
Yeah.,7,17,Michael
I know. That’s not why I’m naked. I always work out without my clothes.,9,8,Dwight
Okay.,5,11,Michael
We better.,5,1,Dwight
"Well, you kept-Mary-",2,9,Michael
"Huh, okay.",4,4,Michael
Why are you nodding?,7,17,Jim
Whoo!,9,8,Erin
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?,4,11,Ryan
"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",1,3,Dwight
That's an excellent analogy.,4,2,Dwight
This is for pleasure.,7,5,Andy
"Because I’m so glad you’re back, baby, but I’m just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you’re giving up so much.",9,22,Pam
No.,5,12,Michael
Yes.,3,17,Michael
Mmmhmm. Why don't you start by telling me what you got.,4,5,Jim
"Okay. Jan, we need to talk.",3,23,Michael
When I was asking about the leads.,6,18,Dwight
There's a little more to it.,2,10,Jim
Something full of acid.,9,20,Darryl
"I'm not asking for one, I need it.",7,17,Andy
"OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.",3,19,Dwight
"Yeah, Meredith.",2,2,Dwight
"Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.",9,3,Darryl
"Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. And I have said goodbye to half of them.",7,21,Michael
"Hey, Lauren. Look at you.",8,20,Andy
"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",5,25,Dwight
"No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!",8,4,Dwight
T minus...,5,7,Kevin
He loves to eat.,6,7,Pam
"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. SO SUCK ON THAT!",3,16,Michael
That was the worst joke ever.,7,11,Michael
It may have been the costliest decision I’ve ever made.,9,5,Dwight
"Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put your supervisor on the phone!",3,20,Dwight
What are you guys talking about?Dwight and,2,15,Michael
"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.",7,7,Jim
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.,2,4,Ryan
I didn't even say what it is.,8,11,Andy
It's a good idea.,6,4,Kevin
How do you hate it? It's a cake.,5,15,Jim
"I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.",6,19,Jim
"That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.",9,4,Dwight
"Ok, this is crazy.",8,6,Jim
Loser. Losers.,8,1,Kevin
"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.",5,18,Michael
"I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um...  I can't stand it , I can't stay in here another second. No!",2,14,Michael
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,9,14,Pam
I'm between specialists right now.,7,4,Michael
What?,6,6,Michael
"Ok, I'll stand near you.",2,12,Michael
What's the exact square footage.,7,10,Dwight
I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!,7,16,Michael
"Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.",8,21,Andy
"No, that is huge.",6,3,Dwight
Okay. You ever been in a manager’s office before?,9,22,Dwight
"Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.",3,9,Michael
"Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?",5,25,Erin
"Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.",4,12,Kevin
"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.",7,23,Dwight
Do they even have a bakery anymore?,9,17,Angela
"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?",8,5,Jim
Hey David- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.,5,9,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",7,14,Pam
Yeah.,5,9,Michael
"You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn’t even know it. I’ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.",9,19,Dwight
"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?",4,1,Pam
"Yeah, you can.",3,12,Jim
Uh. Dwight.,2,21,Michael
"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?",8,14,Andy
Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.,3,18,Jim
"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!",6,24,Michael
"Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?",3,19,Dwight
That's gotta be tough.,9,6,Oscar
"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",3,9,Angela
"Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.",8,21,Ryan
Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,3,6,Michael
"We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.",7,14,Ryan
Not your birthday.,4,7,Jim
For birthdays!,7,20,Kevin
"Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.",9,22,Andy
What was that?,4,9,Jim
"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?",8,7,Ryan
Good thinking.,8,6,Kevin
I kneel before you.,6,20,Dwight
What's in here?,6,3,Jim
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!,5,11,Andy
"Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.",2,1,Michael
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?,3,8,Jim
“This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack”,8,14,Darryl
Just act natural.,9,13,Dwight
Are you... interested in her guy friends?,6,1,Jim
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,2,10,Pam
"That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",4,1,Michael
Something's definitely wrong.,7,23,Andy
"What, are you talking about me and Holly?",7,15,Michael
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.,8,12,Erin
Gabe? You don't know?,8,11,Dwight
I have herpes.,7,4,Michael
"No, it's passing, it's fine.",6,16,Pam
Sure? Might be a good idea.,3,17,Michael
Are you calling me an idiot?,5,13,Dwight
"All right, I'm gonna go now.",4,6,Jim
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.,6,22,Michael
Wow.,4,8,Jim
"Oh, what's that out there?",6,21,Michael
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.,3,22,Jim
Ow! Robert?!,9,14,Oscar
"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?",9,23,Jim
Move to the exits!,2,4,Dwight
Love you.,9,16,Pam
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.,3,1,Phyllis
"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",6,4,Michael
"Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.",6,3,Erin
"Yeah, yeah.",9,15,Jim
"Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.",9,18,Erin
"Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?",9,6,Andy
Goodnight Stanley.,3,19,Andy
"Yes, a knee-capping could work.",9,8,Angela
"Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.",3,16,Michael
Thank you. I... I don't want those.,3,12,Angela
"I am? Hmm..  Hi, I’m Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?",9,7,Erin
"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including ""Stanley is having an affair."" It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",6,1,Michael
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.,8,14,Oscar
It is so nice to go out with another couple.,5,16,Phyllis
"I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.",7,12,Michael
"She's your wife, you idiot.",5,4,Michael
What the hell was that?,2,6,Michael
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?,9,2,Oscar
I'm on it.,4,7,Dwight
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.,1,1,Oscar
Those girls really wailed on you bad.,4,11,Michael
Lets just go.,7,2,Jim
Punishment fits the crime.,5,13,Jim
"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?",1,6,Dwight
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!,9,3,Angela
"Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.",6,17,Ryan
D-W-I-G-H-T.,2,7,Dwight
So my corner's the one with the copier?,5,21,Pam
"Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it. It's very funny and charming and heartwarming. And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  No! So, take it away, Toby! Whoo!",4,14,Michael
"...And, Jim.",8,14,Andy
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.,5,11,Dwight
"Michael, I need to talk to you.",2,1,Dwight
She had so much -,7,23,Erin
"Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!",5,25,Michael
"Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.",7,5,Andy
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.,9,10,Angela
Wha…Yes. Your attention. Uh because… No that is all.,8,6,Dwight
"You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income. Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie. Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south? She said no! Take that! Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way? I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that? Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's—no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye. Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves.",9,3,Andy
"Oh, no, that's a male model.",7,5,Michael
"Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!",6,3,Phyllis
Ok... alright... here we go. There. Oooookay.,4,9,Michael
Why hello!,6,15,Michael
"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",5,10,Michael
We're loading at one.,1,5,Darryl
"OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.",9,4,Dwight
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.,5,25,Dwight
K... Kevin!,8,1,Dwight
Just sit down!,6,12,Michael
Morning.,7,9,Michael
Kelly got into the minority training program.,6,21,Erin
I know I haven't made this easy on you.,5,1,Angela

"Oh, I see.",8,10,Andy
It’s all right. Andy approved it.,9,19,Dwight
Bye! Hey.,2,22,Pam
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.,8,12,Erin
Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.,3,12,Michael
"Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! I'll get it.",5,26,Dwight
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?,3,3,Jim
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.,2,2,Michael
"It was his birthday, just turned three. So…",9,11,Dwight
Yes.,5,24,Michael
And shake! What? Go ahead.,1,6,Michael
"What'cha talking about?  Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---",4,4,Michael
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...,4,9,Jim
"Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.",4,4,Michael
I've written all of it... in my head.,6,19,Michael
"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",7,1,Michael
Come on. A little bit.,1,4,Michael
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?,9,12,Jim
Well I only want to talk about work right now.,9,16,Erin
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.,3,7,Michael
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,6,21,Michael
The pressure! The pressure!,5,3,Dwight
I think the senator is having an affair.,9,7,Angela
What? You?,5,13,Dwight
Can I join too?,3,13,Kevin
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.,9,16,Darryl
"Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.",3,19,Dwight
So this is fun.,5,14,Jim
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.,8,23,Andy
That is not true.,2,1,Dwight
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.,4,9,Angela
"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Ah! It's not cappuccino.",7,1,Michael
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?,5,21,Dwight
I'm peeing in this empty can.,4,6,Dwight
There's so much more to it than that.,8,4,Dwight
Michael is that scotch?,5,19,Kevin
You still don't know.,5,11,Michael
Check out Dental?,6,5,Dwight
Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.,3,23,Jim
Who likes,7,16,Michael
"Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...",8,14,Andy
"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.",8,4,Andy
"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.",5,15,Dwight
"Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.",4,1,Pam
"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.",6,21,Michael
"Way to go, man.",4,11,Kevin
"Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.",2,22,Darryl
"Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.",7,19,Pam
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.,5,25,Michael
"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?",2,8,Michael
We're never going to get what need from that guy.,5,2,Ryan
"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.",6,4,Pam
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,3,5,Dwight
Why would you do that?,4,14,Phyllis
"Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",3,8,Michael
Oh. Bastard!,5,22,Michael
"I can't, I can't...",2,5,Michael
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.,5,18,Pam
Don't want it.,3,18,Dwight
"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",3,7,Pam
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.,7,4,Michael
Ten. It was the full ten.,9,5,Jim
What?! No! I-I got this. Okay?,9,3,Pam
Who are your role models?,5,5,Andy
Thanks Erin.,7,9,Ryan
"Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta.",3,14,Michael
We have vodka!,3,10,Pam
"Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?",9,2,Kevin
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.,2,2,Michael
I’m not doing the Presentation.,8,17,Jim
"Head table, where I belong.",6,4,Michael
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?,5,23,Michael
Who was that?,3,5,Ryan
...under God...,7,23,Oscar
Right? Rough scene.,8,20,Andy
"I've always gotten along well with Toby. Uh, we're friends. But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily. I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.",4,14,Jim
I don't want to do this.,2,12,Dwight
"I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed.",5,1,Ryan
"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",1,4,Michael
He's hungry.,8,13,Angela
"And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.",7,11,Angela
"Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...",1,5,Michael
You think that's funny.,3,4,Michael
"Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",6,4,Pam
"Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?",4,11,Dwight
"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.",1,3,Michael
"Oh! Wow. Awesome. For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.",6,14,Michael
Before taxes.,8,3,Dwight
I'm going to help you.,7,12,Kevin
"Hey, we're going with the chairs.",5,9,Oscar
"Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.",7,10,Jim
Congratulations to you.,6,1,Andy
"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, ""Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.""",7,11,Michael
"Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",8,3,Jim
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...,2,1,Michael

"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",7,24,Jim
Yes. Of course. Erin..,8,6,Andy
"If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.",6,4,Andy
"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",4,7,Michael
"Actually, could you go inside? I’m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.",9,23,Ryan
"Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.",9,5,Andy
"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",4,9,Michael
"Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?",8,21,Erin
"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?",8,8,Jim
"Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...",5,19,Pam
A...hot chocolate tea,8,3,Jim
"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, ""in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.""",8,9,Andy
"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",2,21,Michael

"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.",5,8,Jim
"Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal. Mr.",9,18,Dwight

"Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.",7,14,Ryan
"You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.",3,11,Dwight
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,2,5,Dwight
I'll ask you a question.,6,10,Dwight
This is so cool.,5,1,Pam
"Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.",2,4,Jim
"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.",5,22,Michael
"Wait wait wait, who said that?",6,12,Jim
"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.",3,5,Dwight
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,6,22,Michael

Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,2,10,Dwight
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?,4,10,Michael
She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--,6,4,Michael
"Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?",8,13,Angela

"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --",7,22,Jim
You come so prepared. Aspirin.,9,21,Jim
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.,2,15,Dwight
"Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. ""Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in."" Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?",3,23,Michael
No.,1,1,Michael
"Not now, Temp.",6,11,Dwight
"Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.",3,6,Michael

"Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?",8,5,Andy
Are you wearin' lady clothes?,3,18,Darryl

"Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.",6,19,Pam
Angela. Nope. The ashes.,4,6,Jim
Wow.,2,16,Jim

"Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?",6,19,Erin
"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",7,5,Michael

Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.,3,15,Michael
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.,5,12,Michael
Yes I can.,6,5,Andy
"Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.",4,13,Andy
"Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",6,16,Jim
I'm just worried about my friend.,4,14,Michael
Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?,6,14,Michael
"Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?",6,19,Andy
Busted.,1,6,Michael
"Hey, so this isn’t matching up with this…and I’m not sure which one’s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?",8,2,Jim
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.,4,4,Michael
"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.",2,8,Pam
"No, I think it is-",6,14,Michael
"Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.",9,9,Phyllis
"OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.",1,2,Dwight
Kidding. Acting!,4,14,Michael
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.,6,7,Michael
"Mm, then I will make up a cause.",9,1,Andy
"That was slightly harsh, don't you think?",4,2,Jim
...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...,2,18,Dwight
Cool... This is your desk.,2,9,Pam
"Oh, oh yeah.",8,6,Jim
Yeah?,6,16,Michael
Could we talk off the record? As friends?,4,8,Ryan
It's good to be home.,6,6,Pam
She said she was going to give it to him right now.,5,8,Michael
Bang.,9,8,Darryl
"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?",2,3,Dwight
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,3,8,Michael
Ah! My hand! That's hot!,5,13,Oscar
"Guys, she's in there.",5,7,Michael
"I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.",6,16,Kevin
Mmmm. Yeah you're right.,3,13,Andy
I go to a lot of parties.,2,20,Ryan
Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.,9,14,Pam
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.,1,2,Michael
"Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.",6,6,Andy
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.,8,14,Erin
I heard you say “well” the first time.,9,23,Dwight
"Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.",5,2,Michael
I work with that guy.,7,3,Dwight
"I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.",7,4,Michael
"I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.",2,17,Jim
"Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.",7,9,Ryan
"Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.",3,19,Dwight
Nope. OK.,8,14,Jim
I just needed you to know. Once.,2,22,Jim
I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?,5,1,Michael
"I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?",9,20,Jim
"Come here, I’ll show you.",9,1,Dwight
"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.",8,13,Andy
You are not my superior.,1,3,Jim
Thank you. I’m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.,9,7,Dwight
"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize.",6,11,Jim
Where are you going?,1,3,Pam
"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.",6,4,Pam
"I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.",7,10,Dwight
"Is it me, or are we just a little off today?",5,3,Jim
"Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.",6,19,Pam
"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.",4,1,Pam
Didn’t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?,9,23,Andy
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.,2,2,Pam
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,2,17,Jim
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.,6,12,Kevin
"Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.",7,11,Dwight
There's...,1,6,Pam
"No, we've been dating for six months.",3,21,Jim
"No, I don't, I...",4,10,Pam
When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,8,13,Pam
"This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.",4,3,Michael
You got it.,7,11,Jim
Okay. What? What is this?,2,3,Pam
"Her boobs, definitely.",2,13,Michael
I will never be your vichyssoise.,3,21,Dwight
Hi honey!,9,18,Oscar
"All right, well it already went through, so...",4,14,Jim
He does have a gift.,9,22,Pam
"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?",1,2,Michael
"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.",2,8,Pam
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.,7,18,Pam
I don’t think she’s dead.,8,7,Andy
"you, Gabe!",7,6,Kevin
"Arrr, dooby dooby do. ""You need to do something about your B.O.""",2,8,Michael
Dwight!,7,5,Jim
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK.,4,10,Phyllis
It's not misleading.,8,24,Oscar
Gimme that.,9,2,Dwight
"I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. AH! When... Damn it.",3,5,Dwight
No! You'll thank me later.,3,7,Dwight
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,2,3,Dwight
Eric likes Megan.,6,1,Michael
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.,3,11,Angela
"Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.",2,9,Jim
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.,2,20,Ryan
"Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.",9,22,Andy
Andy.,8,7,Erin
"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... what is this?",3,11,Jim
Smokey's dead.,8,22,Ryan
Don't make me pre-fire you.,7,23,Dwight
-I'm just gonna watch.,7,5,Jim
Giant check it is.,4,1,Pam
You sure you're OK?,4,2,Michael
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?,8,13,Darryl
"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.",8,18,Andy
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?,5,5,Michael
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,2,5,Dwight
"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",5,17,Michael
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.,2,14,Michael
"If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.",7,8,Michael
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?,9,18,Phyllis
"Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.",9,21,Pam
"See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, ""Man, I wish I got that."" I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.",2,10,Michael
"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -",6,18,Dwight
"I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.",1,5,Michael
It's a trap.,5,2,Kevin
"Because, she didn't send it to you!",5,15,Pam
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.,9,21,Pam
Not us.,9,11,Pam
Salesman.,5,19,Pam
"When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?",7,12,Michael
"All right, next suggestion.",2,8,Michael
Yes. All right. Great.,8,9,Jim
"Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?",2,3,Dwight
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.,8,9,Erin
"18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank."" Michael wrote, ""Judd?""",2,13,Ryan
"Oh, nothing.",2,14,Jim
"Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?",6,8,Angela
Define foment.,7,23,Dwight
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.,8,22,Kevin
"It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.",4,11,Ryan
"Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.",5,13,Kevin
He/she/it throat rips.,9,3,Dwight
"Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.",1,5,Dwight
Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.,5,24,Ryan
You sure?,7,21,Jim
"Get the hell out of here, idiot.",6,6,Michael
"Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.",5,4,Pam
Do my hands feel sweaty to you?,6,20,Kevin
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.,8,19,Andy
How's the family?,7,24,Dwight
"Oh, no. Your battery fell out.",5,25,Pam
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.,7,18,Michael
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?,9,16,Andy
"Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.",5,4,Kevin
Paid.,8,16,Angela
"Yeah, but I'm confused...",8,8,Erin
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.,3,20,Jim
How much time do you have left on your break?,2,20,Jim
Is that my grandmother?,8,5,Oscar
"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?",1,3,Michael
"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",1,6,Jim
What do you call it? Schruteball?,2,3,Jim
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,6,4,Michael
On three. One... two... three.,3,8,Dwight
"Don’t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.Off-camera Well we’re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.",9,1,Pam
I'm going into labor!,8,8,Pam
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?,5,22,Michael
"I, I need to get to the paper please.",9,4,Angela
What are you wearing?,9,10,Phyllis
"No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.",4,3,Michael
He's like a better-looking Andy.,7,5,Kevin
"No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.",6,7,Michael
"A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?",4,10,Michael
Oh yeah! Yes he is!,7,16,Michael
"Either way, Dwight… I can’t be there for you. I’m sorry.",9,23,Jim
Honey.,7,7,Pam
I want an answer by tomorrow.,2,21,Dwight
The same stuff you get downtown.,6,7,Michael
"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",2,5,Dwight
Pieces of paper.,7,24,Darryl
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.,9,20,Jim
Are you mental?,4,13,Michael
"Okay, bye bye.",5,12,Michael
"Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",2,6,Michael
"Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit.",6,2,Andy
"Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.",5,14,Andy
"No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about…",8,2,Andy
Hey!,9,23,Jim
Where are we in the process?,8,3,Andy
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,5,17,Michael
Phone's ringing.,8,15,Andy
"Like, with who?",4,14,Michael
I don't... I don't think so.,6,21,Jim
Dwight's grandfather was a—.,9,3,Andy
"Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you’ve had.",9,11,Erin
"It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.",2,17,Michael
"Ooh I didn’t mean to offend you, and I hope you’ll forgive me because I am very very… Sari. Sixteen points.",8,2,Andy
"Yeah, go ahead and stop. You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.",4,4,Dwight
"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.",6,4,Andy
"It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is bold the right word?",3,10,Jim
"Evan, this is Jim.",3,2,Michael
Now. Now. Now.,4,12,Dwight
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.,9,22,Darryl
"Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?",5,18,Angela
Pssht.,2,12,Dwight
"Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.",9,20,Angela
"No, no, no.",3,17,Michael
"Yeah, right. I’m afraid that ship has sailed.",9,21,Dwight
"I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.",8,18,Erin
And what happens here is-,7,19,Jim
Dwight Schrute.,6,22,Dwight
"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",6,22,Pam
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.,3,9,Michael
"No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the...",7,24,Jim
"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.",6,16,Dwight
"Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.",7,3,Dwight
"Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.",3,10,Angela
"For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.",2,4,Ryan
"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.",1,2,Oscar
Clarice?,5,13,Dwight
Now you ruined it.,4,10,Michael
"You say yes, and we go out.",2,2,Michael
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.,4,2,Jim
Oh. What the hell is that?,2,3,Michael
"You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.",3,23,Jim
"Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.",8,4,Oscar
"I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.",8,19,Andy
"That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.",4,4,Jim
Any messages for 308? All right.,3,2,Michael
"Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.",9,4,Andy
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.,7,6,Michael
"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.",2,20,Dwight
"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you.",3,23,Pam
"Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...",6,20,Erin
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?,7,23,Pam
"For my current investors, things are going great.",7,9,Ryan
"Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",4,3,Michael
"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.",3,8,Andy
"Oh, she's great.",2,22,Michael
"No. Now, remember that honesty...",1,2,Michael
"Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.",9,21,Dwight
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?,2,22,Darryl
I've had intercourse in the office.,7,15,Dwight
"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",6,23,Michael
Yeah.,5,17,Michael
"Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.",5,13,Dwight
"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",7,1,Michael
Hello.,5,24,Michael
I think you're good. Doing a good job.,6,16,Jim
"Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?",5,14,Jim
Sea horse.,9,22,Dwight
"Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.",2,18,Michael
The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!,7,8,Erin
Maybe I'll quit.,3,3,Phyllis
Great.,8,7,Pam
Smart baby. That’s the most flavorful bond.,9,22,Dwight
"No, I don't!",5,3,Michael
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.,2,1,Phyllis
"Yeah. ""I vant to count to ten"".",6,20,Pam
Just make that copy okay?,5,21,Michael
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.,4,12,Dwight
What are you standing for?,5,11,Jim
"OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.",3,22,Michael
"Come on, Gabe, you can’t handle his hamstrings. You’re getting hypno-thigh-zed.",8,23,Jim
"OK. careful, thanks.",3,19,Jim
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.Mary-,2,9,Michael
Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.,6,8,Dwight
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?,9,3,Andy
"Ok, goodbye Prince Family.",5,12,Michael
"You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.",2,3,Michael
"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.",3,19,Michael
We were something else.,5,24,Pam
"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?",5,22,Michael
"Dwight, let me up.",2,1,Pam
Is Gould dead? What uh-,2,7,Michael
What about February 2nd?,5,10,Oscar
"I know, I know.",6,1,Michael
"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.",6,17,Jim
"Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?",9,9,Darryl
"I guess, yeah.",2,16,Pam
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.,3,9,Andy
Now I have it.,2,4,Ryan
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,3,8,Jim
And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.,3,19,Darryl
What? Erin is that true?,7,17,Pam
"What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.",7,6,Andy
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?,4,8,Jim
"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .",6,10,Andy
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.,6,10,Andy
Why would anyone go to jail for that?,3,9,Pam
"There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!",7,20,Michael
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.,7,18,Phyllis
"Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?",6,7,Michael
Michael...,2,1,Pam
"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight’s night, okay?",9,23,Jim
"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",1,3,Michael
Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.,5,19,Pam
We'd love to see it!,7,16,Pam
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?,2,21,Angela
"Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!",7,3,Erin
Maybe I'll stay.,3,18,Michael
"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",2,20,Michael
For?,5,19,Michael
"Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.",3,2,Michael
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?,1,3,Angela
So.,9,21,Jim
That's ironic.,2,22,Michael
What do you like Pam?,7,21,Michael
"I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.",2,4,Pam
Just make him stop the freaking bus!,7,7,Andy
Are you playing for the other team?!,3,3,Andy
"What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!",9,8,Oscar
What's the square footage?,3,17,Dwight
Gladly. I quit.,3,20,Angela
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,5,3,Dwight
We got a live one! On fire!!,5,10,Dwight
"Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.",4,10,Phyllis
Ugh.,7,12,Angela
Stupid.,4,4,Dwight
"No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.",8,16,Dwight
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!,5,5,Andy
"That is all sir, you may go.",5,5,Dwight
"So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.",4,14,Jim
Can't you? That's so nice.,3,3,Michael
That is so mom.,8,7,Andy
"Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.",8,3,Jim
"He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!",2,1,Michael
Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,6,23,Andy
"Yes, but one good text away from a high five.",7,10,Andy
Alright.,2,1,Jim
Who is that?,9,17,Oscar
Of course. I own my toothbrush.,8,19,Andy
"I didn't, it's from corporate.",3,10,Pam

"Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.",8,14,Ryan
Huh. Uh huh.,9,7,Pam
But it just may be a lunatic... No.,7,9,Michael
Is that off again?,8,6,Jim
You made a big mistake. Huge!,7,2,Dwight
Can't stop.,4,8,Michael
"Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.",6,21,Oscar
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",2,12,Michael
Right.,2,10,Jim
"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.",6,5,Michael
"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.",6,1,Michael
The tires look pretty worn.,3,10,Kevin
"Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.",9,12,Pam
"Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, ""I have cancer.""",2,19,Michael
"Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.",2,4,Michael
"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",3,7,Dwight
"Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.",9,12,Dwight
David Wallace is calling.,6,2,Erin
Now you move on.,5,4,Phyllis
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.",3,11,Michael
That's unacceptable.,2,13,Dwight
"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",5,11,Andy
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?,3,13,Michael
"And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?",7,2,Michael
No. There's a lot I haven't done.,5,23,Michael
No.,2,8,Michael
"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",2,6,Pam
"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.",3,8,Pam
Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.,7,23,Andy
Mmhmm. Caramel soy latte.,8,6,Darryl
"I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?",8,3,Dwight
Give me the baby!,7,7,Kevin
Thank you. I knew it.,5,10,Pam
"Please Ja, Ja...",9,15,Dwight
Your own paper company.,5,19,Dwight
"Take that, Saddam!",2,10,Dwight
That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.,2,8,Michael
"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women’s soccer, no?",8,1,Andy
Everybody!,9,23,Dwight
"So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.",9,4,Dwight
Because we're not married.,1,3,Pam
"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",9,15,Dwight
"You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.",1,6,Michael
Too late.,9,4,Darryl
Hm? Okay. Yep.,2,11,Michael
"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",9,16,Dwight
"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.",7,17,Dwight
"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",4,10,Michael
Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.,4,3,Jim
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. He's my boyfriend.,2,10,Phyllis
Yeah. Do you have any ice?,3,17,Michael
Aah!,9,13,Dwight
"Mose, bags! Now!",4,4,Dwight
Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you!,2,19,Michael
"You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.",8,8,Darryl
"Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.",2,3,Angela
Concussion. What did you write?,2,12,Jim
"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.",6,7,Pam
Witch’s brew?,8,5,Erin
"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.",9,16,Andy
"No. Jim, come on.",4,4,Dwight
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.Man on,1,3,Michael
"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.",4,10,Jim
Thanks so much Earl.,8,23,Dwight
"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.",5,15,Michael
Go-Go dancers?,4,3,Angela
"Come on, just do it.",9,21,Andy
You were right.,5,6,Jim
"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",7,24,Jim
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.,7,5,Andy
How about you?,6,9,Erin
"Pam, hello.",3,23,Dwight
What? Why?,5,5,Michael
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",7,10,Jim
"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",7,16,Michael
"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.",2,9,Dwight
"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",6,18,Michael
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.,5,11,Jim
"""The skin is the largest organ of the body.""",2,19,Ryan
Yep. Hey!,8,10,Andy
"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",3,13,Michael
"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.",7,17,Dwight
"Cause that says, that says...",4,12,Andy
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,7,17,Andy
"Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Sorry, he is very lame.  Um, let's see. ""Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.""",3,19,Michael
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,3,1,Dwight
"You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. Are you a golfer?",6,22,Pam
Hey.,5,18,Jim
"Good work, buddy.",6,20,Ryan
"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",8,12,Dwight
Oooo. Catcher or in field?,4,10,Michael
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?,7,5,Andy
"No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.",2,9,Michael
"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",8,8,Dwight
I had no idea.,3,20,Andy
"Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.",9,14,Erin
"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",1,4,Jim
Sounds good.,3,18,Jim
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,2,10,Michael
"Members of the office, hear ye.",9,22,Jim
"Here we go, let's sit down.",4,11,Michael
"No, I am the King bee,",2,13,Michael
"Oh, I know I'd be more productive.",9,4,Phyllis
Charley horse!,2,14,Michael
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?,6,24,Pam
"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?",8,18,Andy
"I'm not changing that, it's the best one.",2,1,Michael
"Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.",7,24,Darryl
Because of reasons...,3,17,Kevin
"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",2,5,Michael
Hmm.,6,7,Pam
I would love to hear the other mottos.,8,15,Jim
You can't be serious. Are you serious?,2,22,Dwight
"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable.",2,21,Michael
You don't have to say it like that.,4,3,Michael
Not by a long shot!,8,8,Dwight
Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,3,4,Michael
"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",2,3,Dwight
Twelve drummers drumming.,6,12,Pam
"All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?",2,4,Ryan
Cons. Wears too much makeup.,3,21,Michael
"Here we go, fourth time's a charm. ""Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... Hey. Are you crying?",5,5,Michael
"Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then... song  Think you've had too much / in this life.",2,4,Jim
"Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?",4,4,Michael
"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.",6,21,Pam
"Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.",3,19,Kevin
"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",7,1,Michael
Come on Dwight! Use words.,2,4,Jim
"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.",8,19,Andy
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.,4,1,Dwight
"Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.",3,19,Darryl
"It's drying, it's drying...",4,12,Michael
Forget about my mural. It's stupid.,9,14,Pam
"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it’s your call.",9,13,Dwight
"You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is.",2,21,Phyllis
"A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.",7,20,Andy
"Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.",8,3,Andy
"Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",3,7,Andy
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,9,13,Jim
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?,3,17,Michael
Oh stop! I am so sorry!,9,10,Pam
"So I’ve got your resume here, but it’s not telling me everything.",9,13,Dwight
Boo! Boo!,7,3,Darryl
Come on.,9,1,Dwight
I was ahead of you!,8,17,Erin
"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...",2,11,Michael
"Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.",7,18,Michael
"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",6,15,Dwight
It is.,5,20,Michael
Shut it!,6,6,Pam
"I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?",7,5,Michael
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.,7,12,Kevin
She called you D?,4,5,Dwight
"Whoa, a video iPod.",2,10,Ryan
"Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.",3,22,Michael
"Oh, that's red eye.",3,11,Michael
Okay.,5,24,Michael
How'd you even find it?,4,8,Michael
"Don’t talk to me right now. I’m sorry. I- I know you’re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don’t understand is...",8,17,Ryan
Hey. Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.,5,26,Michael

You are toxic! You are toxic!,8,21,Ryan
"985,000,000,000,017.",9,22,Jim
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.,6,18,Michael
"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably ""freedom."" At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.",6,12,Michael
Do you know anything about physics?,4,8,Andy
I'm not a master bee.,2,9,Michael
"Yeah, you don’t want Italian. You’ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you’ll be doing life in Rikers Island.",9,11,Dwight
My mom.,2,16,Oscar

"Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.",8,18,Andy
Hey... What?,4,14,Jim
Case Logic.,4,4,Oscar
...Or biologically.,2,18,Michael
And your stupid face! And your stupid office! Ah!,8,21,Andy
"Okay, see you later.",9,11,Pam
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.,3,23,Ryan
"Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.",3,10,Darryl
There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.,5,10,Andy
Foth aggendak!,9,3,Erin
In this car?,5,6,Jim
"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.",5,23,Pam
"Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?",9,22,Oscar
You can't do that.,3,10,Pam
It's called a costume.,8,5,Dwight
Six on seven.,1,2,Jim
"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.",9,16,Andy
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.,3,2,Michael
No!,3,18,Michael
And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.,5,18,Michael
"Okay, go, go, go, go!",6,16,Michael
"Cool, so maybe hook me up with some Fleebulls and some Hive.",1,6,Michael
"Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.",9,14,Darryl
I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.,5,5,Darryl
"Oh, it's so wet.",7,23,Dwight
"Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.  I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon.",5,8,Dwight
Done.,5,1,Dwight
Here we go! Have Pam come down.,7,20,Michael
"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.",7,1,Michael
"Oh, I, um...",5,24,Pam
I don't know. Just let it vibrate. It's fine.,8,19,Andy
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can’t get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --,9,7,Angela
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.,8,14,Darryl
Yes.,4,8,Michael
"Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.",8,8,Andy
"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.",1,3,Michael
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.,9,15,Dwight
"Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!",4,4,Michael
Time out. You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?Air Force recruiter I think Justin can be anything he wants to be.,4,13,Michael
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.,7,21,Angela
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!,5,17,Dwight
"Oh! Seven new comments. “The guy at 019 is hawt!” “Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 019, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!” “He's not hawt, he's gay.” “Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.” “He is hawt!” See, thank you, that's more like it. “He is butt.” God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!",9,18,Andy
"Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.",6,15,Ryan
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.,6,4,Pam
"Yeah, bigger actually.",3,23,Jim
Pam.,6,16,Jim
I think you're right.,8,14,Jim
Do you really know which one is correct?,4,4,Ryan
"Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.",3,18,Dwight
"Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",5,16,Michael
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!,8,2,Andy
Yes you were.,8,6,Pam
"Oh, I like you.",4,13,Jim
"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...",2,19,Michael
Nine and three-quarters.,6,4,Dwight
"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, ""I do."" And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...",5,9,Dwight
"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.",2,6,Michael
"Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.",5,12,Dwight
"I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.",3,19,Jim
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,6,5,Michael
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.,5,1,Michael
How thoughtful.,9,22,Angela
Tonight.,9,6,Andy
Hello. Sorry guys. Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.,6,12,Erin
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!,7,11,Ryan
All right.,5,3,Michael
Whatta we got?,5,3,Michael
"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.",7,18,Michael
Pamela.,5,24,Michael
You play that.,2,3,Angela
He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.,6,1,Dwight
Why should I believe that?,5,11,Andy
That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,5,10,Michael
"Oh, yes indeed... When! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! When!",8,22,Andy
"OK, keep in mind, it’s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car for a thousand points….or best offer.",8,2,Andy
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.,1,5,Pam
"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...",9,14,Dwight
I can't hear what you said. You got your slop?,9,20,Erin
"Oh, I dunno about that.",3,6,Michael
"Oh, would that make you feel better?",6,6,Pam
"Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I’m okay with that.",9,8,Pam
Why won't more people do that?,4,1,Jim
Ah-ha.,4,3,Pam
"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.",9,14,Dwight
"Hit it, red!",9,22,Phyllis
What if they deserved it?,9,8,Angela
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!,9,16,Erin
What?,2,22,Michael
"Okay, bye.",9,22,Angela
"Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?",1,6,Jim
"Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.",5,5,Dwight
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?,6,21,Ryan
"She's not your grandmother, is she?",8,10,Jim
We have nowhere else Jan. This...,2,15,Michael
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!,7,4,Michael

Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.,7,15,Michael
"One, two, three..",6,9,Michael
So... how was lunch?,6,20,Andy
I do not want to talk about it.,2,22,Kevin
"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",7,11,Michael
"I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.",4,14,Andy
"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.",8,19,Dwight
"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question ""How'd I get to be so awesome?"" Because, I don't have an answer for you.",3,23,Jim
Aaaaaaaa!,5,3,Dwight
"Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat?  Let's all clap at Phyllis. Ok!  When Michael Clump wants to remind you that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.

"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.",2,6,Michael
"Thank you. You, too.",7,3,Michael
You don't get it.,6,18,Michael
"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...",4,10,Michael
There they are. What's up? Hey hey.,2,16,Michael
"Pam, what can be done?",9,14,Oscar
"Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.",8,3,Phyllis
"Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.",7,19,Erin
"I call foul, sir.",5,24,Andy
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,2,8,Dwight
"Ah, yes. Ah.",1,5,Michael
But that doesn’t matter. This does. It’s the only thing that matters. We’ve had some really nice days together.,9,21,Jim
"Peepa, how is she?",7,24,Dwight
"Aw, preemie pajamas!",8,13,Angela
Hey.,9,14,Jim
I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.,6,8,Dwight
So he won't get caught!,6,5,Phyllis
"You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...",4,11,Michael
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.,6,20,Erin
"Call, text or e-mail, or call.De",7,20,Erin
Mmmhmm. Yes.,2,2,Michael
I'm so glad you could come.,7,11,Angela
"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",6,11,Michael
"Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.",2,17,Michael
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.,2,13,Jim
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.,1,1,Dwight
Coffee?,6,5,Michael
And one girl push-up.,6,19,Dwight
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.,1,1,Angela
But it's not until next month.,1,4,Pam
Bro hug? Back to basics. I like it.,5,7,Andy
... still burned in my eyes.,4,1,Pam
What? This is such bullcrap!,9,13,Dwight
"Okay? ""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-""",6,17,Dwight
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.,7,15,Michael
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,6,3,Jim
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.,2,17,Michael
"At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",2,15,Angela
"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",6,12,Michael
You can't have it I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.,3,10,Angela
"Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?",9,9,Jim
"All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.",1,6,Michael
"Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.",8,4,Andy
Jedediah.,6,16,Angela
"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.",2,4,Dwight
How about a little visit?,8,13,Pam
"Oh, hello there. But what are you doing?",2,10,Dwight
"Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.",3,16,Pam
"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?",2,13,Michael
The news that you just announced? That Ed died?,3,4,Pam
"Then how is this ""Amazing Race""?",3,12,Phyllis
No. Sorry.,3,13,Phyllis
"Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke.",5,23,Ryan
"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn’t you say?",9,1,Dwight
And we did.,8,3,Erin
Phillip’s your son.,9,22,Angela
"Well, here are your options you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.",4,12,Dwight
"Ah, thank you sir.",2,19,Michael
It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.,3,19,Pam
This place is like sexy pre-school.,4,11,Michael
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.,8,11,Andy
"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.",9,15,Andy
And I found out that there's a bus at 500 a.m.,9,9,Jim
I... have... things...W.B.,4,10,Kevin
"Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.",2,18,Jim
"Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.",6,9,Dwight
"How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.",7,21,Michael
"OK. Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.",3,10,Jim
No politics?,7,10,Jim
Look who you're talking to.,6,2,Michael
"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",3,3,Michael
Uh huh.,2,4,Michael
"Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.",1,4,Michael
"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?",5,9,Michael
"I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?",3,10,Angela
"Yeah, that's right.",2,12,Jim
"Okay, you can stop.",8,12,Dwight
"Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.",9,16,Erin
"I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",4,7,Michael
"Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.",5,6,Jim
"Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.",7,2,Michael
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.,6,17,Andy
"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.",8,13,Jim
"Wow, um... Sorry you had to...",3,6,Ryan
"I need to say, ""What the hell is that? What the hell is that?""",6,22,Michael
"Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.Michael &",6,1,Andy
No. Not that I see here.,9,3,Andy
You ready?,9,1,Pam
"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.  Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.  Adios!",2,7,Michael
"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",2,11,Michael
Someone has it.,1,3,Kevin
A triple word.,7,13,Oscar
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?,8,7,Ryan
"Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace.",1,6,Michael
Higher? Okay. Recently certain events have come to my attention...,6,22,Andy
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!,8,14,Andy
We should do it right here in the break room.,8,20,Angela
Okay. There you go.,2,18,Michael
Nein. Sits. Goot.,8,3,Dwight
That wasn't me.,3,15,Phyllis
"Radisson just gives out this vibe, ""Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson"". It's kind of snooty. So.",2,7,Michael
"Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?",5,5,Dwight
"Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?",4,13,Michael
All right.,6,5,Michael
"Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.",9,2,Erin
She's nature's bounty.,5,3,Andy
Oh. Oh God.,8,1,Pam
"Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started.",6,3,Jim
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.,7,4,Michael
Really Jim? Really? Very funny.,8,12,Dwight
"Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.",3,22,Michael
"Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can.",2,20,Pam
"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",1,3,Michael
"Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?",2,18,Kevin
Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...,5,13,Michael
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.,6,19,Michael
"The mob, maybe NASA.",5,6,Jim
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.,8,3,Jim
This is gonna make him feel better.,3,18,Darryl
"Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.",2,7,Jim
"Oh, I didn’t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.",8,1,Jim
No.,6,16,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!",9,8,Erin
Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?,4,3,Michael
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  Y'all having birthday cake?,6,2,Dwight
"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.",3,8,Michael
"It does, but still no.",9,13,Dwight
"Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.",9,10,Erin
"Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.",6,16,Pam
"Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.",3,5,Dwight
Scared me. How's the party planning going?,4,14,Jim
What? Shut up.,7,7,Michael
They're on the supply shelf.,5,1,Pam
Is that the police?,4,14,Pam
"Toby, just do it! God!",6,23,Michael
"F. Alright, what's the damage?",2,19,Dwight
"God, you look like such an idiot.",2,6,Michael
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.,2,4,Michael
Hey. I got the information.,2,19,Ryan
"You need the big guns, yes?",7,5,Michael
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!,8,8,Andy
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.,6,7,Michael
He's my best customer.,2,14,Dwight
"So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?",9,9,Kevin
"Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.",6,5,Michael
"You have to keep your hands down, Michael.",6,8,Pam
Black tie optional.,7,20,Michael
"Oh, that was fantastic.",9,17,Kevin
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?,6,8,Kevin
"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!",6,8,Michael
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,3,13,Michael
What are your top five cases?,5,23,Jim
Hey.,3,13,Jim
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.,5,22,Dwight
"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.",2,5,Dwight
No... No...,3,21,Michael
"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.",2,15,Michael
Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.,6,8,Michael
"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",6,21,Michael
"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.",6,9,Andy
That's not what you said earlier.,1,3,Michael
Stop the bus! Stop the bus!,7,7,Andy
"Oh, we don't recycle.",7,9,Pam
"I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.",4,1,Oscar
"Yeah, she ended things.",9,10,Darryl
Did you see Holly's butt?,5,1,Michael
"I'm gonna go find Toby. Oh, here's what you do.  You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell. You know?  Fewer carbs.",4,12,Ryan
"Step 1, disinfection. Step 2, incision. Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.",3,23,Andy
I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!,2,8,Dwight
"Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.",4,4,Michael
"Yes, I'm jumping.",7,11,Phyllis
Very valid.,5,9,Michael
Is Matt around? I got his check.,6,12,Oscar
"Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?",6,16,Michael
"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.",4,5,Michael
Yes... I miss you.,4,2,Dwight
Yeeeeah.,6,5,Andy
"Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.",2,6,Ryan
But your mouth is ble—,9,1,Oscar
They want you to pay for it.,6,7,Erin
You're leaving?,3,22,Dwight
"Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.",5,23,Michael
I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,4,4,Michael
"No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it.",8,2,Jim
"Stairs. Oh, man....",5,5,Darryl
"Yes, maybe I'm not.",5,2,Dwight
The old one two. Let's do it.,2,14,Michael
I know. I'm taking them down.,8,5,Angela
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.,2,5,Angela
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,9,15,Jim
Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.,6,7,Andy
You did?,7,12,Michael
Frame him?,5,8,Michael
Right?,9,18,Jim
"My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.",1,1,Angela
Angela?,4,1,Pam
"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?",9,10,Dwight
Here we go! Are you ready?,7,19,Michael
"Yeah, I gotta go David. Why is Nellie still here?",9,1,Andy
"Um, usually like that.",3,10,Pam
"No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer.",5,23,Pam
"The fridge, got it.",7,14,Pam
"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",1,6,Jim
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.,5,16,Michael
"Oh Dwight, Dwight,  Ohhhhhh!Jim and",2,12,Jim
"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",2,11,Michael
$650 bucks,2,4,Ryan
Altoid?,3,15,Jim
"I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.",5,22,Dwight
"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.",7,11,Andy
"You did not, Kenny!",8,20,Andy
"So, where did you learn how to play?",4,8,Jim
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.,3,13,Dwight
Okay. I promise.  For the record your mom came on to me.,6,8,Michael
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.,7,6,Darryl
"Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.",7,13,Pam
"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.",6,21,Jim
"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.",9,10,Kevin
"Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.",9,16,Angela
"No, impish or admirable.",9,9,Dwight
"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.",4,9,Michael
200 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or -,7,23,Erin
"Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.",9,4,Andy
"Rolph, did you not hear me?",5,26,Angela
It was the new one I did.,3,12,Pam
"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?",9,7,Pam
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,8,7,Dwight
"Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.",6,18,Kevin
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.,4,9,Michael
I want to do this.,3,14,Dwight
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,2,17,Michael
I'll order you some cranberry juice.,4,11,Dwight
"Yes, I can. uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just… we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.",8,16,Jim
Abercrombie & Fitch?,1,5,Pam
That's not going to happen.,3,3,Dwight
Maybe.,3,17,Michael
Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?,4,6,Jim
"Well, this is intimate.",7,7,Angela
"Well, what if you're cold?",7,1,Kevin
"Michael, did you finish yet?",2,6,Angela
Do I still have a job here?,5,24,Erin
"Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?  Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  Yes, Kevin.",5,10,Michael
This is your big day. Come on.,6,10,Andy
"Stop the bus, okay?",7,7,Michael
"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?",8,1,Dwight
"They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.",4,11,Dwight
"Yeah, it was.",5,7,Oscar
I can't believe it was me.,6,4,Jim
I'll just go get a ginger ale.,3,10,Phyllis
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?,9,18,Erin
"Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.",7,16,Erin
"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",2,5,Michael
"Wait, wait. What's this?",8,3,Pam
"Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?",9,2,Andy
"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",1,5,Michael
"I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.",8,8,Jim
Yeah. Totally.,9,14,Jim
"I'm a very good interviewee. Why? Because I have something that nobody else has. And that is... my brain. Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... and quick on my feet.",3,23,Andy
"And say what? ""Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?""",7,22,Jim
So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?,7,21,Pam
"Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.",2,22,Michael
"You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.Pizza guy I'm not going in there.",4,3,Michael
"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.",8,12,Dwight
You got it.,9,22,Jim
I played a lot of pong growing up. I spent a lot of time on cruise ships. I'm also a monster snorkler.,4,8,Andy
"Clutch cream run, bro.",7,1,Andy
"You know me very well, Dwight.",7,19,Michael
"Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.",3,14,Michael
Ahh! I can't-,2,1,Dwight
It was really funny.,7,1,Pam
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,8,6,Jim
"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",1,4,Jim
"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.",7,11,Andy
Oooh.,7,15,Kevin
"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.",1,4,Michael
At least he is in the building.,5,19,Oscar
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.,9,4,Dwight
You left me in a bad part of town!,5,1,Phyllis
I think she's doing a good job.,6,12,Jim
"Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.",1,5,Pam
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.,7,9,Angela
Why would people say that?,6,11,Andy
"Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.",6,14,Michael
"Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.",4,4,Oscar
How much did you pay for that?,9,14,Darryl
Sup?,7,12,Darryl
"Yes, thank you.",2,16,Michael
"Wanna dance, Dwight?",5,25,Phyllis
That's not...,4,1,Michael
I don't know how you got there.,8,4,Andy
I'm gonna walk away.,5,18,Michael
"I don't know, it's just...",2,1,Michael
Right.,1,3,Jim
Honey! What are you doing here?,9,6,Angela
Stop it.,9,22,Angela
Vamping.,5,1,Dwight
"A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.AJ Hey Michael.",5,26,Michael
Goggles?,2,17,Jim
"Uh, I'll hear the other one.",8,4,Andy
What did I say?,3,13,Michael
"What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.",8,8,Andy
"Okay. Um, her.",3,19,Michael
De-fense! De-fense!Warehouse worker Well done team.,1,5,Dwight
Want me to say it again?,6,1,Angela
"Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.De",7,21,Michael
Cool. For who?AJ For us.,5,26,Michael
"Oscar, it was an honest mistake.",6,4,Pam
You're the stupid one.,9,2,Dwight
"Aww, best book?",2,18,Jim
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.,1,5,Dwight
That feels so good!,8,12,Erin
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.,1,6,Jim
I can't believe we called her up.,5,7,Oscar
"I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can’t—",9,21,Oscar
Unfair. When’s my birthday?,9,8,Jim
"I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.",9,16,Angela
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.,2,13,Dwight
No. Why? No.,5,6,Dwight
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.,5,26,Michael
"I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?",3,11,Dwight
"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",4,1,Michael
"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.",4,9,Michael
"No, everything's fine.",9,6,Dwight
Can't your other cats keep her company.,4,1,Pam
Stop the bus!Michael and,7,7,Andy
"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?Dwight, Jim &",6,1,Michael
Yeah. Get another one.,4,8,Andy
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.,4,2,Dwight
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.,8,6,Dwight
"Wait, should I have left the car running?",5,26,Jim
"Oh God, that's a terrible idea.",5,16,Dwight
"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.",1,1,Dwight
"That would be great, thank you.Andy and",6,17,Jim
Thank you.,6,6,Pam
Ugh... I'm in.,7,16,Michael
"Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-",8,8,Andy
"I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.",5,3,Michael
"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.",2,5,Michael
"Bye, Phillip. High five.",9,22,Kevin
Jim...,2,5,Pam
"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",6,7,Jim
But sometimes he talks about flesh… and bacchanals.,8,23,Pam
"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",5,9,Pam
Maybe you should. Whatever.,4,4,Dwight
"Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.",2,1,Michael
Stephanie could you hop off please?,6,12,Michael
"Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.",6,8,Jim
"Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-",7,21,Michael
I have a new place.,5,10,Michael
"Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.",5,7,Michael
Andy He's gone.,5,19,Phyllis
"Oh, that's very funny.",3,13,Oscar
Like hell you are.,7,5,Dwight
But I don't have any...,2,11,Dwight
That's the character's name?,2,7,Phyllis
"Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.",9,18,Oscar
Hey Mer. How ya doing?,4,1,Michael
"Michael, do something!",3,22,Pam
Well you gotta figure this out.,6,1,Jim
"Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.",5,5,Darryl
"OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",2,21,Michael
"And the sequel, ""Woman Stands at Desk and Works."" So, I have no idea how you, how you sit like that.",4,14,Michael
That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.,6,16,Jim
"Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.",8,21,Ryan
"Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. No offense. You going, Toby?",9,23,Darryl
That's probably good. That's enough.,7,17,Andy
"Well this is what happened uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as ""misleading the shareholders."" Another good term is ""fraud."" The real crime, I think, was the beard.",4,14,Oscar
I'm not talking to you.,5,6,Jim
"The buyer is your sister’s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that’s an order.",9,19,Dwight
"All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.",2,1,Michael
I am jumping.,7,11,Phyllis
"Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.",6,8,Andy
What? What are you doing in there?,2,3,Michael
"Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.",5,6,Jim
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.,3,8,Michael
...your help. I love her.,3,20,Andy
Please do.,6,16,Jim
What if you’re being attacked by a … smallish man who happens to not have a groin?,8,17,Andy
"Oh, God. Oh, God.",6,11,Michael
The Electric City. Scranton!,6,13,Michael
How's the party coming along?,7,11,Michael
Thirty-two meatballs.,8,12,Dwight
I'm sorry.,3,19,Kevin
"Gahh, I will pull this car over!",7,8,Michael
"Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.",3,22,Michael
Is this real?,2,7,Jim
"Knock, knock.",5,17,Dwight
What's a Nazi?,2,18,Michael
"I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.",9,22,Darryl
He brought a sled.,5,14,Pam
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,6,10,Jim
"Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.",8,17,Darryl
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,5,10,Michael
"We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.",5,21,Pam
"Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.",5,8,Michael
"His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam’s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn’t see it, or didn’t wanna see it.",9,11,Dwight
"Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.",8,7,Kevin
"Always the padawan, never the Jedi.",7,20,Dwight
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?,6,1,Kevin
"This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.",4,4,Oscar
"I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.",7,9,Michael
Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.,3,18,Darryl
You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,2,21,Michael
"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",6,5,Michael
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.,9,9,Dwight
Snack attack time.,6,13,Michael
"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!",6,12,Phyllis
Very nice.,6,17,Michael
"Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. What?",9,5,Andy
"Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.",5,21,Michael
"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?",9,15,Pam
I think the engineer left.,4,4,Michael
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.,2,17,Jim
What if they made out? In front of everybody?,2,2,Michael
"I don't know, same old stuff. Same old. Boss just been ridin' my ass.",2,9,Michael
"Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me.",3,20,Angela
"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",2,12,Pam
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.,5,3,Pam
Yeah.,5,2,Michael
"No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.",1,6,Michael
"I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.",9,20,Angela
"Yeah, what day? What day?",6,16,Andy
"NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!",5,8,Michael
"A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.",3,16,Michael
I don't think you had to.,9,14,Jim
"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.",4,13,Michael
Then why the question?,2,8,Jim
Because we're looking up jail time.,4,3,Oscar
"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",4,7,Michael
"Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don’t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.",9,21,Jim
"I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.",4,13,Pam
Mmm-hmmm.,2,3,Pam
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.,5,3,Jim
"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.",7,24,Jim
"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?",9,1,Dwight
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.,5,17,Michael
"Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer.",8,3,Dwight
"If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you.",5,24,Ryan
What are you-,6,19,Dwight
"Three, two, one!",6,12,Jim
I'm gonna take you home Michael.,4,9,Dwight
That snake!,9,18,Dwight
"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.",5,17,Michael
"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?",9,10,Pam
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!,8,10,Dwight
Men find me desirable.,5,8,Dwight
It's a cafe disco.,5,25,Erin
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?,5,18,Michael
Michael. Get off the bus.,7,7,Oscar
British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?,9,4,Andy
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?,9,7,Pam
Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy.,9,1,Andy
Am I going down a road?,5,22,Jim
"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",2,16,Pam
"Hi everyone. My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.",4,12,Pam
"Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?",9,3,Jim
"Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.",7,23,Jim
"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.",5,8,Dwight
You know what? Go. Have fun.,8,11,Andy
Most do in the magazines.,5,23,Michael
"Oh, okay.",4,1,Michael
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.,2,9,Michael
Do you want me to find out what it says?,2,1,Michael
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!,3,13,Michael
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.,7,3,Jim
With that I can buy... half the menu.,7,14,Michael
Hey-o!,4,9,Andy
This drink...,3,10,Andy
"Sir, you have some messages.",2,7,Phyllis
"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",2,2,Michael
You're good... you're good at sales.,7,2,Jim
You... owe me.,2,19,Jim
"I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?",7,3,Michael
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.,9,5,Andy
That should not be there.,2,19,Michael
"Well, uh, another option.",5,13,Dwight
When was the last time you went to the doctor?,8,7,Pam
"Alright let's go! This way, this way! De",7,20,Michael
We'll have to talk--,5,23,Michael
All right.,5,4,Michael
You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?,5,8,Dwight
There's... a name.,6,4,Michael
Excellent! Way to go! Nice!,5,12,Michael
"Great, right up there.",8,24,Dwight
Silence.,8,18,Dwight
Idiot.,5,13,Michael
Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine,3,15,Pam
"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.",3,6,Andy
Is that not what happens when you're high?,3,11,Jim
"I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?",5,12,Dwight
"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.",4,6,Dwight
Do you remember Ed Truck?,2,14,Michael
"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?",8,9,Dwight
"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.",2,16,Jim
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.,5,20,Michael
"Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.",7,12,Dwight
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.,5,6,Michael
You're welcome.,6,3,Michael
Stop. Out with it.,7,13,Pam
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!,6,12,Andy
I am Oscar Martinez.,9,8,Kevin
"I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?",5,1,Pam
"I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer. Go.",4,3,Angela
"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",2,21,Michael
"Sure, what's up?",1,4,Jim
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?,8,21,Erin
"You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.",9,3,Pam
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?,3,18,Michael
"This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",2,18,Michael
"Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",8,7,Dwight
Just - sh -,6,13,Michael
Okay. Hello.,5,16,Michael
"Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like Dave died or something.",5,25,Michael
"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.",3,16,Michael
"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",4,5,Michael
"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",1,3,Jim
You said...,3,13,Andy
"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",2,20,Michael
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,6,20,Andy
"Oh, geeze.",3,19,Kevin
Hi stranger! Long time!,7,4,Michael
"Oh, nothing that exciting.",9,19,Pam
"... and... we had sex, too.",6,22,Michael
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.,8,9,Darryl
I can field this one.,8,15,Ryan
It's about Michael.,3,3,Dwight
Because I wanted you to like me.,5,5,Darryl
"There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!",4,14,Michael
"Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.",3,18,Darryl
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.,3,15,Kevin
Song's about truth.,7,5,Darryl
Get lower.,8,21,Kevin
"Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!",6,6,Pam
"Well, I only ask because he's a senator.",7,11,Angela
"Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.",3,23,Jim
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!,5,26,Michael
"No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.",2,13,Pam
"Jan, have you ever had deer?",2,8,Dwight
Let's just- let's go.,8,20,Pam
"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",2,21,Dwight
Hey! There she is. How you doin?,9,16,Jim
"Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!",3,14,Michael
How many dates have you been on?,6,22,Andy
K. I brought cheese too.,6,8,Dwight
Do you think that they've ever...,7,8,Andy
Don’t tell me what to do!Angela &,9,22,Kevin
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don’t even care about nationals.,8,23,Dwight
"Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.",9,9,Kevin
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!,6,19,Pam
This looks like a hoot.,6,19,Angela
Okay.,6,8,Michael
"It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.",3,17,Michael
What did you think was going to happen?,6,12,Michael
Second.,2,8,Jim
"Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.",6,1,Michael
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.,3,8,Dwight
"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.",1,1,Jim
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?,5,17,Michael
AHHHHH!!!!!!!,8,2,Andy
Maybe we will someday.,5,20,Jim
Yeah! Da na na na na.,5,5,Darryl
"Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.",5,8,Dwight
"Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...",2,8,Pam
Right? I was just thinking...,4,7,Jim
Sure. Hoops!,6,19,Oscar
Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.,6,16,Jim
You in the boss's chair!,7,24,Erin
"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",6,11,Michael
"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.",1,4,Dwight
Danny Cordray is the worst.,7,5,Dwight
I have one idea of what it means.,2,8,Pam
Nope.,7,6,Jim
"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!",1,5,Michael
"Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...",6,20,Michael
Oh! Darryl's funny.,7,23,Erin
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...,2,15,Michael
"Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.",4,4,Michael
I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!,3,19,Michael
No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!,4,3,Michael
"Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.",3,5,Dwight
"Yeah, I killed.",6,9,Andy
"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.",8,14,Dwight
"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",2,10,Jim
"Yes. Thank you, mom.",6,4,Pam
"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.",7,18,Pam
"You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish!",9,9,Dwight
There's nothing out here man.,5,5,Darryl
Best day ever. Best day ever!,7,17,Michael
"Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the ""C thing.""",6,16,Pam
You ahh.,7,17,Michael
"Oh, oh.",4,10,Pam
Any messages?,1,1,Michael
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.,7,13,Erin
Okay. All right.,4,8,Michael
"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.",4,10,Jim
You'll thank me when they spank thee.,5,7,Andy
"You're a lion. Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.",2,5,Michael
"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.",3,10,Dwight
That... you got a promotion! Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,8,14,Andy
"Hey Kevin, what are you doing?",8,2,Andy
"The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!",5,3,Jim
How would you like it if we booed you?,7,3,Darryl
What kind of mileage does this baby get?,6,10,Dwight
The other way.,7,12,Ryan
45.,7,18,Kevin
Signed what?,2,6,Oscar
"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",7,7,Dwight
Pam.,9,5,Jim
"Come on, Bernard.",5,1,Dwight
You’re not gay.,9,23,Oscar
Oscar!,5,13,Angela
What does it look like?,3,10,Dwight
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.,9,17,Dwight
"Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.",1,5,Michael
Or none of you,9,13,Dwight
Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.,2,12,Jim
"Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.",5,8,Dwight
"Question. How long do we have to... Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",1,1,Michael
"Thank you, Andy.",8,10,Dwight
"I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.",5,2,Kevin
Nifty!,3,8,Andy
This is you. How much do you charge?,6,22,Michael
Nope.,7,7,Jim
Oh my God! What if I did?,7,4,Michael
I think those might be empty.,2,1,Jim
No. I don't.De,7,21,Andy
"No, I did that before, it added nothing.",5,19,Jim
Yep. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.,9,12,Pam
Even as pie.,5,4,Michael
Yeah where is it?,7,18,Darryl
"Push harder, Dwight.",7,23,Kevin
"Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.",4,6,Pam
"No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.",2,1,Dwight
"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.",3,8,Michael
"Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.",8,1,Dwight
"Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.",4,13,Michael
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...,2,21,Ryan
"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.",6,16,Michael
Hey Ryan? Could you get to that copy from before?,5,21,Michael
"Bye, Stanley! Love you!",7,6,Pam
"Well, I think she has a kid.",2,12,Jim
"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.",8,20,Andy
"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...",2,4,Michael
"I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.",9,17,Dwight
"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",5,10,Dwight
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. Can you just fill out the form please?,9,10,Pam
"And you are not going to, either.",5,19,Jim
"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.",1,2,Michael
"These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.",2,3,Jim
"Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy!",2,2,Jim
Well...,2,20,Michael
I-,7,6,Michael
We should do something.,6,1,Erin
Oh...,2,20,Jim
I thought it was a workspace?,1,3,Jim
"No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.",8,15,Dwight
"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  They don't have copiers. They don't even- Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",5,9,Michael
Ok. I got one.,7,14,Oscar

"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.",1,6,Michael
What's with the smile?,8,11,Dwight
Ah...,5,23,Michael
And it also helps if you've had five shots.,7,17,Michael
"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",6,22,Dwight
Cool. Okay. Bye.,6,5,Kevin
You tricked me!,6,20,Erin

"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",2,20,Michael
"Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.",3,11,Dwight
"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where's the sales office?",3,5,Ryan
Andy had Erin.,6,12,Michael
"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.",2,10,Kevin
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!,6,12,Phyllis
"Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...",2,5,Angela

Your fictitious name?,5,12,Dwight
How are you doing?,5,17,Michael
Thought I'd catch a show.,3,23,Michael
Absolutely correct.,3,18,Jim
"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",3,5,Michael
"Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.",3,18,Michael
...And it's all from the same series.,3,16,Pam
"No, that's ridiculous.",5,21,Andy
I'm ready.,8,12,Erin
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.,7,5,Dwight
"No, you had no right!",9,14,Pam
"It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.",9,9,Dwight
There is no such things as monsters.,6,5,Michael
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.,4,4,Andy
"You okay, man?",5,11,Jim
"God, Dwight!",3,7,Michael
"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.",2,12,Michael
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.,5,12,Dwight
I'm not gonna lock my door.,6,5,Michael
"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.",8,11,Andy
"Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.",4,14,Michael
"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",7,5,Michael
He even looks like a mole.,9,14,Dwight

Should you drive the forklift?,3,19,Darryl
"Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?",2,14,Michael
"Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.",4,14,Michael
"Oh, okay.",6,16,Michael
"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",2,11,Michael
But you didn't fail.,7,10,Jim
"I'm sorry, he's not in right now.",5,16,Pam

"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",3,2,Michael
See?,6,7,Jim
At least I got chocolate.,9,23,Kevin
I'll take it.,6,9,Jim

It is a terrible year for love.Pam's mom Yeah. Guess it is.,6,4,Michael
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.,6,23,Andy
"Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.",1,2,Jim
I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?,5,14,Andy
You're thinking of deer penis.,6,8,Dwight
Think so.,9,2,Pam
"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",2,11,Michael
Too late. My hopes are up.,9,13,Pam

"Can I have your attention please? I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? Okay, then I will come to you, my flower.",4,14,Andy
"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.",4,5,Michael

"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.",5,17,Dwight
Nice! We got burned!,7,17,Kevin
I was just trying to be unbiased.,6,3,Jim
"Well, I'll be in my office.",2,18,Michael
"You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.",5,14,Phyllis
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.,8,9,Andy

"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.",9,14,Dwight
"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...",2,13,Pam
You're not.,5,6,Michael
"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?",5,16,Michael
"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.",8,9,Andy
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,6,4,Michael
"I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.",4,1,Oscar
"No, watching TV at work is really cool.",5,15,Kevin
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.,8,10,Andy
"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",2,2,Michael
"I’m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.",9,21,Andy
"Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!",2,13,Michael
"Put your hand up, Norma Rae.",6,24,Phyllis
"Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!",9,10,Dwight
"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.",3,3,Michael
"Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.",3,2,Michael
"Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.",6,6,Michael
How would you do that?,2,22,Dwight
"Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?",5,17,Oscar
Fine. Fine.,2,12,Michael
"Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.",4,3,Dwight
What's going on?,1,1,Jim
Kitchen.,3,3,Angela
"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... con-quack-ulations!",6,6,Dwight
"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, ""Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?"" ""High-five, Donna."" ""Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?"" ""Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.""",6,23,Michael
"All right. Thanks, man.",2,10,Darryl
"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.",7,16,Pam
"Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.",7,21,Jim
He's good at his job. And I like working for him.,7,22,Jim
Carol.,3,10,Jim
"Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.",8,3,Andy
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.,6,14,Jim
Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!,3,19,Dwight
"We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know? The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom. So.  I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  So, sexy is fun...",4,13,Michael
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!,3,8,Michael
"You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.",4,4,Angela
"Everybody. He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.",4,12,Michael
I need you to breathe in my face right now.,9,13,Jim
Mmm! There we go.,8,15,Dwight
So much more than words...,4,12,Andy
"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.",1,3,Michael
Absolutely. Works for me.,8,14,Erin
Yeah.,3,1,Michael
You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.,1,6,Michael
Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Um...,4,14,Michael
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He’s not terrible.,9,21,Phyllis
Right. Let's do some good.,4,1,Jim
"No, they can't.",5,17,Michael
There you go.,2,1,Michael
"Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?",7,4,Erin
"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.",3,2,Jim
"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?",3,23,Michael
"No, I made brownies.",2,5,Pam
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.,3,6,Andy
You're not staying?,5,5,Darryl
"Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. I’m all for it.",9,19,Andy
You pushed Darryl out the window?,4,1,Oscar
He literally won't come out of his office.,1,3,Oscar
He knows what he's doing.,8,16,Jim
Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.,3,20,Jim
"Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.",1,5,Angela
"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.",7,11,Michael
You keep think that.,8,2,Kevin
"Michael, just go park the car.",6,16,Jim
It's labeled.,2,20,Phyllis
I just told them to do it!,7,15,Oscar
"Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.",3,13,Jim
Got it. For Channel 11 news...,9,2,Erin
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!,2,12,Dwight
"Why do you lie, liar?",3,12,Michael
We're not going for yogurt.,6,24,Pam
When do we want it?!,9,4,Jim
"Uh, that seems inappropriate.",9,23,Pam
You're good.,5,21,Dwight
"Yeah, totally you did.",9,21,Jim
Screwgun. The sales call!,3,5,Dwight
"Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.",4,3,Dwight
Dammit!,4,13,Andy
"Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!",8,15,Dwight
"Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.",7,4,Andy
"There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .",4,7,Michael
Yeah. Poor Angela.,9,19,Phyllis
"Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.",6,22,Dwight
"You should learn from him, right?",2,4,Dwight
"Pam, are you all right?",2,1,Dwight
What? What?,7,11,Michael
"I started a fire, I started a fire.",4,3,Michael
Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,8,7,Pam
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.,9,16,Andy
I'd love to talk more about it.,7,10,Oscar
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.,5,6,Michael
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.,6,20,Angela
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.Michael and,4,6,Michael
"Yeah, real cool. Real power move.",7,19,Phyllis
"I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.",7,8,Andy
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.,5,15,Dwight
I am telling Andy.,5,11,Michael
I am the bait.,5,8,Dwight
"Listen, it’s important. You’ve gotta hear this.",8,17,Kevin
"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque.",6,18,Michael
He’s making a statement. It’s an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.,8,2,Oscar
"Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",3,4,Michael
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.,6,11,Ryan
Hit the nos.,8,23,Dwight
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.,5,19,Michael
It is my idea.,5,17,Dwight
Oh! You got it? What is that?,6,12,Michael
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. Look at that.,4,10,Michael
You messed up saying your name?,8,19,Pam
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.,7,19,Darryl
"Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. C'mon, my treat.",3,10,Andy
Guess I’m going upstairs.,9,22,Darryl
What are you making?,5,4,Phyllis
Why are you- How do you know?,8,1,Jim
"No, Michael.",5,23,Pam
"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.",3,9,Angela
Would you excuse me for a second?,3,23,Michael
"Leave me alone, okay?",2,5,Michael
"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",9,17,Pam
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.,3,10,Andy
What? What am I gonna do? I don’t –,8,23,Jim
"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.",1,1,Michael
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.,4,4,Ryan
"Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?",9,13,Pam
Fraud.,5,2,Jim
"Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude. Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.",4,12,Pam
"That place doesn’t exist. It’s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?",9,11,Dwight
"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",8,14,Dwight
"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",4,6,Michael
"What do you say, Jan?",2,8,Michael
"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... willingly, or as slaves.",8,13,Dwight
"No, don't push. Pull. Pull.",6,16,Jim
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.,5,22,Pam
"Hey, Angela! Welcome to -",5,25,Erin
"Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.",7,21,Pam
"Fire him. No, show mercy.",7,10,Erin
Sure we'll go.,4,3,Jim
Who's that?,6,18,Jim
Yes.,4,12,Michael
"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",2,11,Michael
"Well, busier. Making the time.",2,6,Michael
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.,7,9,Michael
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.,2,15,Michael
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.,6,22,Darryl
"Well, hobbies--",6,8,Michael
Woah-Oh! Haven’t been in one of these in forever.,9,23,Darryl
Toby can I see those? Ooh. What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?,5,8,Michael
All right. Okay.,3,4,Michael
"We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they’re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, “Nice jugs”?",9,22,Pam
"Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.",2,18,Ryan
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 445. There's only 15 minutes left.,8,6,Oscar
Loser.,8,5,Dwight
I'm the head accountant.,2,18,Angela
