"What, um... what do you think of role-play?",3,21,Michael
Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.,2,1,Michael
"Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!",7,19,Michael
"Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?",1,3,Jim
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.,8,6,Oscar
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.,5,22,Michael
So did everybody ...,9,5,Pam
The most important one of the guys.,2,9,Dwight
"Jim, what are you doing?",4,14,Dwight
Seventeen. I say seventeen squares.,5,3,Michael
"Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.",4,11,Ryan
I am. You should come dance with us.,3,6,Pam
O...K.,8,10,Jim
I don't understand the point of a hat.,7,6,Darryl
"That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?",8,8,Jim
"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.",4,11,Jim
"It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...",7,24,Kevin
"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.",8,6,Dwight
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?,5,2,Dwight
It really was.,6,6,Pam
Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.,9,15,Darryl
"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",9,14,Jim
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.,9,3,Oscar
Luke? Luke!,7,1,Phyllis
I don't even know who you are anymore.,6,21,Jim
"No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.",5,3,Michael
"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.",5,20,Pam
"Put the ""q"" there! Sorry I yelled.",7,13,Oscar
I don't kn--,3,1,Michael
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,5,10,Jim
"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?",7,7,Jim
That's fun.,6,22,Michael
"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.",9,15,Andy
"Guys, we can’t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.",9,7,Phyllis
Ok.,3,3,Michael
"So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn’t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.",9,1,Kevin
"Watch this part, okay?",9,21,Dwight
Hello Aunt Shirley.,9,16,Angela
"Yeah, I might stop by.",6,2,Ryan
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.,7,7,Michael
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.,6,10,Michael
"Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?",2,20,Michael
Hey! You're unstable!,3,23,Michael
I think we could.,6,21,Michael
"Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.",1,6,Michael
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. Hang on. Hello?,8,9,Andy
"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",6,23,Pam
Uh... that I have not decided yet.,3,8,Michael
You first.,3,2,Michael
"Oh, Roy.",1,1,Jim
You should get one of these.,2,8,Dwight
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.,6,12,Michael
"If everybody... could do it? ""Meredith is so old...""",1,4,Michael
And you didn't invite any of us?,7,14,Andy
He definitely stole my iPod.,5,24,Jim
"No, no, that guy who hit on me.",5,26,Pam
Nothing. It's mine.  What happened to my Tavis Smileys?,9,14,Darryl
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,2,10,Michael
I was thinking exactly the same thing.,6,5,Michael
"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.",8,21,Dwight
Ay-o!,4,1,Andy
You're back in.,7,22,Pam
That's fine.,1,1,Dwight
You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,2,21,Michael
"No, I should probably go too.",3,5,Pam
No communication with the outside world Jim.,4,6,Dwight
"I forgot if there was an ""e"" between the ""l"" and the ""y."" I still don't know.",5,15,Jim
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.,8,10,Darryl
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!,8,12,Angela
"Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?",3,19,Andy
"Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?",8,4,Andy
"It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.",2,1,Michael
Monkey.,5,1,Dwight
Three to four hours.,8,14,Dwight
"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.",8,19,Andy
I thought it'd be funny.,5,18,Jim
"You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.",8,15,Dwight
I’m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You’ve got a regional manager.,9,22,Jim
Hail to the chief!,3,23,Andy
I can't decide what to get.,4,14,Kevin
"...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...",3,16,Ryan
How long has he been in the bathroom?,8,17,Dwight
"Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.",8,10,Darryl
Thank you.,5,14,Pam
Are you enjoying your mineral water?,4,2,Dwight
Ahh! Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.,8,15,Andy
"No, I think they mean more like a politician.",9,19,Phyllis
"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.",8,19,Jim
She would get this little foam mustache...,3,10,Michael
"Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.",2,13,Jim
"Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.",8,24,Jim
I take it back.,2,4,Pam
"Hey, Toby.",4,1,Pam
"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",2,22,Michael
"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",7,7,Michael
That's me.,9,4,Kevin
Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.,5,8,Michael
"You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",7,1,Michael
"Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I’m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don’t worry, he’s the best in the biz.",9,22,Jim
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.,5,24,Ryan
"Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.",7,9,Ryan
Do you need 'em?,5,4,Michael
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.,5,1,Oscar
"The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.",3,15,Michael
"OK, I'll call the real police.",3,21,Jim
"She's engaged, um... to me.",5,4,Jim
We won't let you down.,4,10,Andy
Bye Pam.,3,10,Dwight
"Hi, Toby.",7,11,Kevin
Who knows?,4,3,Darryl
Give it to me Dwight.,2,12,Michael
"Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate!",1,2,Dwight
"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",2,5,Dwight
"Would you rather me say ""Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?""",6,11,Andy
Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!,3,15,Michael
"Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.",7,3,Angela
"I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...",5,14,Pam
You can't. You can't.,7,13,Andy
That's never the case.,6,7,Angela
"Oh, thanks. You're not bad, either.",6,21,Michael
"No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.",9,13,Dwight
I'm already in business school.,2,11,Ryan
"You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we’re in this together.",8,2,Pam
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!,5,3,Michael
"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",1,3,Dwight
"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.",5,11,Jim
"Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.",5,16,Michael
You should get out of them.,3,14,Michael
"Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?",2,20,Ryan
Idiot.,2,11,Michael
"Haha, what?",8,3,Andy
"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",8,14,Andy
I'm sorry.,5,25,Kevin
"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",2,12,Michael
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.,9,15,Andy
"So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that!  Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale!",2,14,Michael
Please don't do that.,2,9,Michael
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.,3,17,Pam
I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.,2,8,Angela
"Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.",6,1,Michael
Hey.,2,3,Jim
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,2,11,Michael
Yeah Not that they're not smart people.,8,3,Jim
You are being too modest.,3,22,Michael
Can you arrange a meeting?,9,8,Angela
"Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.",9,2,Darryl
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,5,10,Jim
"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",9,14,Dwight
"Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?",7,4,Michael
I really think we should join forces on this one.,7,17,Jim
"Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?",5,6,Dwight
You embarrassed me earlier.,6,20,Angela
She wandered off like an idiot.,7,14,Erin
Who's that?,3,23,Jim
"No, he's not making this up.",8,24,Erin
"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?",9,1,Andy

What's America gonna do?,7,10,Erin
OK you are useless.,9,16,Dwight
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.,9,4,Darryl
"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",4,7,Michael
"Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.",9,2,Andy
As an object.,4,4,Ryan
"You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.",2,22,Angela
"-Cornell Application Department,",5,5,Dwight
That is not the question.,5,12,Kevin
"All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.",9,5,Dwight
You guys are throwing a lot at me.,5,17,Kevin
Okay.,4,13,Michael
What is that? It is your birthday period.,5,14,Jim
"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?",9,22,Jim

"Ok, alright.",2,7,Michael
I've got the key.,2,6,Dwight
All right. Formative years.,6,17,Andy
"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?",7,10,Dwight
You have to agree with me. That's insane.,5,1,Michael
"Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.",5,14,Pam
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-,7,5,Jim
Hello? Hello?,5,7,Angela
"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.",7,17,Andy
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.,5,19,Dwight
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,6,6,Jim

This is not work talk.,3,21,Angela

"I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.",9,8,Jim
"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",2,11,Michael
"You're gonna make another ""spreadsheet.""",5,21,Pam

Hey Dwight.,4,4,Jim
There is no way that that was---,5,2,Dwight
"Yeah, maybe I’ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it’s the most pleasant I’ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.",9,19,Dwight

"Yes, I... Do you want to...",1,1,Jim
Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.,6,8,Michael
"Well, that was quick.",7,24,Jim
"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?",5,4,Oscar
"Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.",2,18,Michael
"Michael, you should stay home and rest.",2,12,Phyllis

Go get your laptop.,5,15,Pam
"You're gonna like this. ""Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--""",6,4,Dwight
"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, Dwight out!",6,18,Dwight
Do you love him?,5,11,Andy
"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.",6,8,Pam

"Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!",7,4,Michael
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?,7,21,Jim
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,2,10,Michael

Good policy. Sensible. Smart.,8,6,Darryl

I thought he was out on the road.,2,14,Dwight
"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.",4,2,Michael
"Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!",3,4,Michael
Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.,5,19,Michael
"Yes, a madhouse.",7,3,Andy
And you'll compare the times?,3,8,Dwight
There's no way I'm gonna do that.,7,4,Michael

Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.,7,1,Jim
You seem suprised.,6,11,Dwight

"When me President, they see.  They see.",8,2,Kevin
"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.",8,14,Dwight
Pay him whatever he wants.,5,6,Angela
"Okay, this isn’t working for me, ‘cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.",9,7,Dwight
"I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.",7,18,Darryl
"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?",5,18,Michael
He’ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He’s allergic but he’ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.,9,23,Ryan
Sive drafely.,8,6,Dwight
"Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.",1,4,Dwight
"Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.",7,10,Oscar
What a douche bag!,7,11,Michael
"Oh, please.",8,23,Dwight
That's my corner.,5,21,Michael
"Roll in the hay, five dollars.",7,9,Dwight

How is that relevant to anything?,7,4,Andy
"Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!",2,4,Dwight
I thought I did. So...,5,17,Michael
"Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.",4,6,Dwight

It was kind of hard to hear.,1,2,Kevin
"Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.",1,5,Ryan
Give me the details of how that happened.,5,17,Michael
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea .,5,17,Dwight

"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.",9,15,Jim
On the drums! On the drums!,2,22,Pam
Wow! Lot of calories.,4,11,Dwight
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.,6,20,Erin
"Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes…and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that’s…an amazing gift.",9,23,Jim
Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!,9,4,Andy

"Which is, of course…",9,22,Dwight

May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.,3,20,Dwight
"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.",8,5,Andy
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.,2,1,Phyllis
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?,9,22,Andy
It stopped.,6,19,Jim
"No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--Andy and",6,17,Jim
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.,5,6,Jim
Alright.,7,2,Jim
"And I used to say ""Hey, got latte?"" And she'd say, that's not funny.",3,10,Michael
How many buttons do you have?,8,16,Jim
Obesity-caused illnesses.,5,1,Dwight

There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.,3,15,Michael
Shut it! That's... suck up!,3,8,Michael
"Excellent, thanks.",3,1,Pam
"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.",6,15,Dwight
"That's the whole point, dummy.",3,19,Michael
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,8,7,Dwight
"Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.",5,15,Jim
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.,6,5,Kevin
Hey!,6,4,Jim
"And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for... Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!",7,9,Dwight
"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.",4,1,Pam
"Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...",4,3,Michael
"Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?A.J. Yeah. Why, are you interested?",5,15,Michael
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...,5,3,Michael
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.,7,11,Angela
Why would you throw something wet at me?,6,23,Oscar
Just for a minute.,1,6,Dwight
"I'm barren, Jim.",9,4,Dwight
Come down and... open it and you'll see.,3,19,Pam

"Michael, you haven't even heard--",5,23,Ryan
I think she's okay.,6,11,Jim

Say you're sorry times infinity...,3,20,Dwight
What is with these turkeys?,9,5,Erin
Dah! Come on!,4,3,Andy
"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like ""where's the Beef?""  Yeah.",4,2,Michael
"I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band “The Grass Roots” in the 1960’s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.",9,23,Dwight
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?,8,19,Jim
Rhythm and blues...,4,10,Dwight
Watch your step.,2,1,Dwight
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,5,13,Michael
Those aren't chips and dip.,2,5,Angela
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?,5,1,Michael
"Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.",5,15,Angela
"Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.",5,20,Jim
Did you just trademark that...,7,24,Jim
Yeah- oh!,8,12,Dwight
"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.",3,10,Michael
Take your shot man!,1,5,Darryl
"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.",9,10,Jim
"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---",4,4,Michael
"Thank you, Darryl.",7,23,Andy
"-and I said, ""I bet I could fulfill you,"" and you said, ""I'd like to see you try,"" and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",8,13,Dwight
"Um, not neccessari...",2,4,Jim
"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",6,16,Jim
You can do this.,5,15,Pam
This is so cheesy.,5,25,Pam
"You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.Ad guy 1 That sounds great.",4,5,Michael
"You may be asking yourself, ""What am I doing on a trampoline?"" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, ""Hey! You ever seen a suicide?"" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note They might think ""Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."" But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!",3,19,Michael
Yeah. Are you ready?,3,8,Pam
"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.",3,9,Michael
She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.,9,18,Pam
"No, I'm a regional manager---",3,20,Michael
You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.,5,19,Michael
"Come on, man.",8,1,Jim
That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. You're all failing right now. Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!,9,4,Andy
Totally reasonable.,7,18,Jim
"We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.",7,9,Ryan
"Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-",5,22,Jim
"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code XV2RDM!",6,15,Dwight
Mema.,6,4,Pam
"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",8,7,Dwight
"First message is ""I love you"". That's from me.",2,7,Phyllis
"I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.",8,5,Andy
We will? I can't. I don't have an idea in my head.,4,4,Michael
"I have to fire someone today, okay?",2,5,Michael
"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.",5,12,Dwight
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.,5,9,Dwight
"Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.",3,10,Jim
"There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.",3,18,Michael
I have a delicious secret.,8,24,Andy
"So it's going great, sounds like.",4,14,Jim
"Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!",6,16,Pam
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.,7,10,Michael
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?,6,10,Ryan
"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.",7,10,Dwight
If-,5,26,Andy
Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.,5,3,Dwight
"Oh hey, Dwight.",3,23,Jim
Kelly...,4,2,Ryan
I'm pretty good at board games.,7,18,Andy
Did the police solve the problem with the...,4,11,Phyllis
I think she's efficient.,4,3,Dwight
"Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!",6,24,Angela
"Arr, dammit!",4,4,Dwight
"Well, that went pretty well.",6,7,Andy
"You know, you’re right! We hadn’t even thought of that, had we boy?",9,11,Dwight
Dwight’s the new manager. He freaking did it.,9,21,Kevin
Yeah?,5,4,Michael
"So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.",5,5,Andy
"Can't back out now, Halpert.",6,1,Pam
"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",9,16,Pam
"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?",5,4,Michael
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.,8,7,Oscar
That was fun last night.,5,7,Andy
"Yeah, sign says ""Begin tour here.""",8,8,Phyllis
"No, not at all. Nope, come on.",6,11,Michael
"It’s just his way of saying, “Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.”",9,22,Angela
Who did this to you? Where is he?,3,11,Dwight
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you’d ever set foot in in this town?,9,23,Jim
10 years ago.,1,6,Pam
What're you doing? You never have plans.,2,18,Kevin
"Ooh, I want to hold the baby!",6,16,Michael
Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,6,18,Pam
"Mmhmm, I'm sorry.",7,4,Michael
"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.",9,15,Dwight
Go. Push!,2,10,Dwight
"Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.",4,3,Jim
One minute ago.,6,3,Dwight
"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",4,12,Michael
"White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.",9,6,Andy
Cool.,2,3,Pam
Any emails today?,2,2,Michael
So um-,9,16,Pam
"Hey, having fun?",8,15,Pam
"Yeah, I do. C'mon.",3,23,Jim
"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?",3,11,Pam
"I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?",6,13,Michael
"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",6,2,Michael
Yes.,3,12,Michael
"We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.",5,6,Pam
Aaaaah!,3,8,Dwight
I think Michael may have snapped.,6,9,Pam
"Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!""",2,15,Dwight
"It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.",6,13,Pam
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?,7,21,Andy
"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.",6,4,Pam
"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.",5,11,Michael
Yeah.,2,11,Michael
That's it for me.,9,17,Oscar
Hang up. Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. Intel has told us there were at least seven.,7,24,Pam
"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.",4,1,Pam

What's under your shirt?,7,6,Darryl
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.,5,15,Kevin
"Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.",7,7,Ryan
"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.",6,3,Dwight
I did?,7,18,Michael
"Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says ""no,"" then she is not interested.",6,21,Kevin
Oh I am. In my own words.,5,17,Dwight
And you brought this guy!,4,11,Ryan
"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.",4,2,Michael
"You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.",5,15,Pam
Six-month anniversary. What?,3,21,Jim
"No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?",3,22,Michael
"That's what she said. The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does ""redacted"" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked ""redacted""... ?",2,21,Michael
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,4,2,Michael
That's a realistic time line.,7,17,Dwight
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.,3,4,Pam
Ryan?,4,11,Michael
Yeah.,2,4,Michael
BFD. Engaged ain't married.,2,11,Michael
"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.",4,9,Pam
Who needs it?,9,11,Darryl
"I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.",3,13,Angela
"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.",2,1,Jim
"Michael, what's wrong?!",3,19,Dwight
Why? Why?,8,13,Andy
Just say you wanna get back together.,4,6,Michael
"Okay, quick. Who says moustache?",8,20,Jim

We have a right to know.,6,1,Phyllis
"Hey, Erin.",7,24,Andy
I can't see.,7,2,Dwight
Just doing my job.,4,1,Dwight
"No, it's not. I did. Yep.",3,2,Jim
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.,4,12,Pam
"Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.",4,8,Ryan
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.,8,9,Dwight
Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. Oh-ok.,2,7,Michael
Well I will prove you wrong.,4,3,Dwight
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.,5,13,Dwight
"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",6,15,Dwight
"Wait, all of them?",9,21,Kevin
"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",6,2,Michael
Yawn. Four seconds.,5,2,Jim
Let's see if any of these will work.,4,7,Dwight
Edgy impressions.,8,10,Andy
"No, they just made out. That's it.",2,8,Oscar
"Okay, see you later.",5,19,Pam

"I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.",7,4,Andy
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.,2,17,Dwight
Nana?,5,20,Pam
"Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.",3,4,Dwight
I-- mmm-- I'm good.,6,8,Michael
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.,5,25,Dwight
Don't leave us!,4,6,Dwight
"I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.",2,16,Michael
No thank you.,9,2,Dwight
Is it a good message or a bad message?,7,18,Pam
"Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.",5,3,Jim

You wouldn't dare.,7,23,Jim
"Oh, man!",7,5,Dwight
"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, ""I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.""",6,21,Pam
"No, Creed.",8,5,Pam
Hmm?,4,9,Pam
"Way braver! You Braveheart, man.",3,19,Darryl
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type marsupial.,7,14,Dwight
"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",7,6,Pam
Would you like to dance?,5,25,Michael
What have you heard?,5,11,Angela
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.,7,13,Michael
"Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?",2,11,Dwight
"You have to write my suggestions down, too.",5,15,Dwight
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.,2,21,Phyllis
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,1,3,Dwight

"Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don’t worry, I won’t lay an egg.",8,23,Angela
"Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?Man on",1,3,Michael
"It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.",3,16,Ryan

It's seems like ya did though-,2,9,Michael

"And as such, I come to you...",4,4,Andy
Slept like a baby.,5,7,Michael
...we wanted to say thank you-,8,14,Pam
"Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that’s the end of it. Right, Pete?",9,12,Erin
Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!,2,5,Michael
"How did this happen, how did I get this?",7,4,Michael
To Can-A-da.,5,7,Michael
"Establish time frames. Keep the phrase ""real dollars"" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.",3,5,Dwight
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... You are going to make us so happy.,5,6,Andy
So it's not a free fall?Man on,1,3,Michael
Oh give me a break.,5,17,Dwight
Well. I don't know.,1,1,Pam

"She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.",5,14,Michael
Because my car broke down.,8,13,Jim
Just trust me.,8,6,Pam
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.,7,7,Ryan
"I still have to look at this stuff, guys.",7,19,Michael
You know what? I should.,3,18,Michael
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.,2,9,Pam
"Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.",3,3,Dwight
"My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal’s going out on.",9,19,Andy
"Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.",5,21,Pam
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it’s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.,9,1,Dwight
"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.",3,2,Michael
Boyfriend.,8,20,Jim
"Well, I won't tell if you don't.",7,3,Angela
"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",9,15,Pam
Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,4,1,Michael
"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight’s a weirdo. We can’t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.",9,13,Oscar
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.,6,23,Michael
"Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.",8,17,Dwight

"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.",6,8,Dwight
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.,7,18,Oscar
"Sorry, not Jim.",8,23,Andy
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,6,23,Michael
"Well, I did it too.",3,2,Dwight
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.,9,16,Dwight
... is there any news on the leads?,6,18,Dwight

"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It’s called “Schrute or Consequences.” You’re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?",9,22,Dwight
"No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?Pizza guy Sales?",4,3,Michael
Let me out.,1,3,Dwight
"These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.",3,17,Dwight
The empanada guy!,8,13,Jim
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.,2,5,Michael
Thank you Angela.,3,3,Dwight
"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",5,24,Michael
"In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.",9,20,Dwight
"Great, they stole my laptop.",5,4,Oscar
"Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.",7,8,Michael
That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,6,3,Michael
I'll go with you.,7,23,Erin
He's rubbing his neck.,7,11,Ryan
The temp at night?,7,15,Andy
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.,7,1,Michael
"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",2,19,Michael
"Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.",6,10,Ryan
"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",4,12,Michael
"Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?",3,12,Dwight
Elliot!,4,11,Oscar
None of your business then. Good. So what weapon?,5,11,Dwight

Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.,8,17,Jim
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.,5,5,Andy
I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.,3,18,Michael
"You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good.",9,14,Kevin
"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.",8,5,Jim
"Uh, Phyllis got a good look.",3,21,Pam
It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back...,3,20,Angela
Yes! Angela! Please...,6,6,Jim
"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.",9,1,Pam
"So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?",8,3,Jim
"And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more. Moving on! Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends ""Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert"".",2,9,Jim
"That's really nice, thank you.",7,8,Andy
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.,4,4,Pam
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!,3,20,Andy
Yes?,6,3,Michael
"It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",6,23,Pam
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,2,20,Pam
"Right. And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.",4,6,Pam
No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.,6,8,Michael
"Michael, I told you.",6,16,Jim
"Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?",8,2,Jim
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.,4,3,Dwight
"This is it, check that out, can you smell that?",4,9,Michael
"It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.",4,1,Kevin
It wasn't me.,2,5,Jim
"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",6,18,Michael
What consequences?,4,13,Phyllis
"Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.",8,22,Kevin
"No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.",7,21,Angela
What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!,7,17,Pam

"Hola, tu es une buena worker?",7,4,Dwight
"Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.",4,11,Michael
"I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.",4,11,Ryan
"Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.",5,14,Andy
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.,3,17,Michael
"Guys, I don't like this analogy.",8,15,Pam
"Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan.",6,11,Ryan
"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",5,9,Andy
"Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. Just stand right up.",3,16,Michael
"No, the country.Mr.",1,2,Michael
"Why don't you turn it up?  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy. Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy? Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.",2,9,Kevin
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.,7,10,Dwight

It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.HCT,9,5,Jim
"Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-",5,4,Michael
$200.,5,10,Dwight
"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.",6,16,Jim
"Well, he didn’t fight me hard on it.",9,8,Angela
"Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",6,13,Dwight
"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?",1,3,Dwight
"Oh. One Erin Special, please.",7,15,Erin
"No, they must have class.",2,6,Michael
I know.,3,18,Pam
"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",6,23,Pam
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!,9,1,Kevin
When I was a little girl...,4,12,Phyllis
"No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.",7,7,Erin
"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.",6,17,Dwight
"Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it. It is pointless technology.",4,2,Dwight
Come on! This isn't fair!,6,3,Phyllis
Wow. Now we can afford hard-cover books.,4,6,Oscar
"No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.",4,4,Michael
W-why did you...,2,1,Michael
"Now, for the last time, I’d like a side salad with balsamic.",9,23,Dwight
Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.,5,24,Dwight
"Really, what kind of celebrity?",4,1,Jim
What? Okay.,9,23,Angela
What does that even mean?,7,21,Phyllis
Do you want me to go back to the store?,6,23,Erin
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?,6,11,Kevin
"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.",4,12,Michael
He only emailed me four times.,9,15,Erin
Hey. I saw you called.,5,23,Jim
Um...,4,2,Pam
"She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.",5,8,Jim
"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more.  Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.",6,9,Michael
I went medieval on his heinie.,2,6,Michael
"Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.",9,22,Andy
"Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.",9,18,Oscar
"Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.",3,17,Pam
"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",5,11,Michael
"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...",2,2,Michael
Something is wrong with you.,6,4,Michael
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.,8,13,Kevin
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,6,22,Jim
"People, it’s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?",9,12,Oscar
Qazer!,9,3,Erin
"We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.",6,24,Michael
"I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.",3,21,Jim
"So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...",4,14,Pam
"Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...",2,8,Michael
"She sent an email, so.",6,15,Dwight
Yes. Yeah.,2,15,Jim
"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.",3,2,Dwight
That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?,7,3,Michael
Did Donna tell you that?,6,23,Andy
She knew it.,5,10,Jim
Per mile.,1,4,Oscar
I don’t think you guys understand why we’re doing this. It’s-,9,2,Pam
"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.",6,2,Jim
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,1,3,Michael

Do you live in a regular sized house?,4,11,Dwight
"Buenos dias, Erin.",6,21,Michael
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---,2,18,Michael
"Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.",9,20,Jim
I just helped someone out. It feels good.,7,17,Pam
"Thank you! What, what is this?",4,13,Michael
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?,8,4,Phyllis
"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",9,15,Pam
"Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.",1,5,Michael
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.,5,19,Jim
Koreans.,7,10,Pam
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,7,22,Pam
And that needs to be straight as an arrow.,6,8,Dwight
That's possible.,3,22,Michael

How sure is this?,6,3,Pam
Or in a great chair.,4,10,Pam
Vanilla. Vanilla Ice. It was a band.,9,16,Andy
Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?,6,4,Dwight
Still want that.,2,17,Jim
I got you... jade earrings.,3,18,Michael
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.,3,10,Michael
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.,8,15,Jim
What?,6,12,Michael
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.,4,3,Phyllis
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?,9,5,Dwight
You went to Cornell?,9,5,Darryl
"No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.",5,13,Michael
Ooh.,9,9,Jim

Then I refuse.,2,20,Dwight
"Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.",9,9,Phyllis
"Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot.",7,8,Michael
"No Dwight, I won't-",9,16,Angela
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.,9,3,Jim
Come.,5,25,Angela
"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",2,9,Michael
"Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.",7,20,Erin
Wait for it.,4,3,Jim

"Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.",8,15,Dwight
"But, what if?",8,2,Jim
Come on. I was in line before you.,8,17,Erin
Perfect.,6,16,Jim
"Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.",4,4,Jim
"You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.",8,19,Erin
"If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.",7,2,Andy
"But, it...",2,21,Angela
Hi. How did you know I was up here?,7,14,Michael

You--- you call--- you called her.,5,7,Oscar
I could have paid for the pizza.,4,3,Michael
"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",6,15,Michael
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.,1,2,Michael
"All right, all right...",4,12,Michael
Why wouldn't you see him? You work for him.,4,14,Jim
Did you bring your jerky in again?,5,13,Angela

"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.",4,2,Dwight
Hey Hank.,8,20,Pam
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.,2,22,Michael
"Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.",3,5,Dwight
I would like it off my desk.,3,10,Pam
And you think that'd be sexy?,3,14,Michael
Yeah. It’s old.,8,2,Erin
"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.",5,14,Andy
"Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what’s up? Back in the small pond?",9,21,Andy

"Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.",3,23,Jim

"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...",2,5,Michael
"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.",1,6,Michael
Let's look at this.,7,17,Michael
Thank you.,6,8,Pam
"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",5,2,Michael
"Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.",5,6,Jim
Oh.,2,22,Jim
"Did somebody say ""baby back ribs""? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?",2,7,Michael
"Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.",8,11,Kevin
"I don't trust you, Phyllis!",3,13,Andy
"Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?Other Guy at",2,1,Michael
"Oh, man, am I a woman?",1,2,Dwight
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.,2,19,Michael
"This branch, I'm the regional manager.",8,4,Andy
They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.,3,20,Dwight
"Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.",3,18,Michael
"Oh, who needs a house that size?",8,12,Oscar
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.,2,3,Oscar
"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. ""Count Choculitis""",1,3,Dwight
"Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, ""I am so lame."" Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... You know what I'm talking about?",2,15,Michael
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.,5,12,Phyllis
70? How many do you type?,3,5,Pam
"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.",8,20,Jim
I was thinking that we...,4,1,Pam
"No, damn it!",2,13,Michael
"Yeah, thank you Phyllis.",5,12,Kevin
These are my painting clothes.I think I’m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.,9,8,Pam
"Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.",6,21,Oscar
"Well, in an ideal world...",6,11,Jim
Night Michael.,6,6,Erin
"Oh, Esther.",9,20,Dwight
"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.",8,3,Dwight
Will you take a check?,6,3,Kevin
"Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere.",9,15,Darryl
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.,4,1,Dwight
Good-bye.,6,4,Jim
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,6,11,Andy
"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.",6,8,Michael
I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,5,13,Michael
"She looks at it when she’s on the potty, and she makes the faces.",8,2,Jim
Can you go instead?,9,7,Pam
Tell me where it hurts.,5,25,Dwight
I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,3,8,Michael
I can see the security guard's eyes.,4,6,Dwight
Michael - Great.,6,18,Jim
"We're gonna watch ""Wall-e"", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.",7,13,Erin
"Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?Air Force recruiter Absolutely. Justin is smart, capable, ambitious, and he aims high.",4,13,Michael
What is it?,9,5,Jim
Are we in danger?,2,9,Jim
"Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?",8,4,Andy
"Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-",8,8,Ryan
I have no idea. We went right for the copier.,3,4,Jim
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,5,16,Pam
"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.",2,3,Michael
"Hello, Holly.",7,15,Michael
Can I sit here?,4,8,Michael
"But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed... whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...",8,10,Ryan
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee. Renegade clubs are dangerous. I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group. They didn't need to gather. It was just gross.,4,6,Angela
I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,2,8,Michael
Six dollars.,5,14,Jim
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.,2,15,Darryl
We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.,7,15,Andy
You just came up with that.,6,3,Jim
"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",6,21,Dwight
"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.",5,8,Dwight
"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. ""I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy"". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.",4,2,Michael
Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.,6,9,Erin
Please hold. Andy! Phone call.,5,20,Kevin
It goes out automatically at five P.M.,8,6,Dwight
"Hey, my name’s Tabitha. I’m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It’s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it’s working. There’s already people camped out behind me.",8,17,Erin
"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",3,21,Michael
Mm-Mmm.,9,9,Erin
Bribery. Nice.,2,18,Jim
"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",4,2,Michael
"Yeah, something like that.",9,14,Pam
"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake.",2,2,Michael
"Okay, we're going.",8,13,Pam
"Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.",7,15,Oscar
"Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.",6,16,Michael
Ohhh...,5,8,Phyllis
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.,5,20,Dwight
Where are gay mens’ vaginas?,9,8,Dwight
"Oh, I don't think you're being silly.",8,12,Phyllis
Jack Blaise.,7,16,Michael
I'm... painting my new apartment tonight.,3,1,Pam
Was the top salesman...,3,13,Andy
"Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.",3,20,Michael
"Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",6,2,Michael
"Kevin, do you accept the apology?",7,17,Michael
Nope.,7,14,Jim
"A formal warning, seriously?",4,12,Jim
Smiles.,3,8,Michael
"No, I didn't.",7,5,Jim
"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.",4,2,Dwight
A piece of paper.,4,13,Pam
Fozzie bear?,2,4,Ryan
"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",5,17,Michael
Good work Pam.,4,1,Michael
Do you think you could work from this? we made some small adjustments.,8,2,Pam
"That's clever, Debutante.",6,9,Andy
You just said it. You just said it.,2,6,Dwight
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.",3,6,Michael
Never...,2,8,Michael
You never... you don't like them.,4,1,Angela
In the box.,8,6,Jim
Um… yes. Definitely. With your hair –,8,23,Pam
"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!",8,8,Jim
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.,6,16,Kevin
That makes sense.,5,25,Jim
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.,9,22,Dwight
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!,2,4,Angela
"Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...",2,3,Michael
"Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.",8,21,Phyllis
The signs will drive people inside.,7,18,Pam
"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",6,3,Michael
"Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-",9,18,Pam
You knocked the mirror off of my car.,5,2,Kevin
"No, it’s not. Here’s how we find out. Let’s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let’s just size each other up here and left side of the list… ATTACK!",8,1,Dwight
Paul Anka.,8,22,Jim
There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.De,7,20,Michael

Cruise control.,3,23,Michael
"Oh, I don't know... Oh my God. This is Jan's cell.",2,7,Pam
Text went through.,9,8,Dwight
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.,8,14,Dwight
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?,4,1,Dwight
"Search his things.Police Officer 2 Sir, can you step away from your desk please?",5,8,Dwight
You're wearing loafers!,6,5,Dwight
Are you going to try it?,3,22,Kevin
"Oh, good, and you resent this because...",6,21,Dwight
Andy's just coming as my date.,8,22,Erin
"You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.",7,9,Michael
Mmhmmm.,8,6,Andy
It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.,8,12,Andy
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.,8,6,Oscar
Oh. He did? What did he say?,6,7,Michael
Cause you’re always taking dumps.,9,1,Andy
"Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live. I mean, you've got it all.",4,11,Michael
"Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?",3,6,Kevin
"I didn't forget them, they're right here.",8,4,Jim
Silver medal.,2,3,Dwight
Alright! Let's do it.,5,20,Jim
"It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.",3,19,Michael
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,7,11,Michael
"Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.",3,18,Michael
"""Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today."" This is really cool.",4,7,Oscar
"Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. This is...",2,2,Darryl
I bet he went home.,8,6,Pam
How does he feel about it?,6,23,Andy
"When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.",3,19,Dwight
Good old Mose.,9,23,Dwight
"Jimbo, last chance to carpool.",3,17,Michael
'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.,8,20,Angela
"Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?",3,12,Jim
"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",1,1,Michael
Is that why your wearing makeup today?,5,14,Michael
"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!",6,3,Dwight
"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.",6,22,Dwight
Here man. You need that more than me.,9,10,Kevin
"It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.",6,15,Erin
Oscar.,5,13,Angela
What's his name?,5,13,Darryl
"Whether it’s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.",8,17,Kevin
"Como estas, senor?",7,5,Oscar
I would agree with that.,8,6,Andy
"So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....",8,3,Pam
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.,9,23,Dwight
Can you do it?,7,13,Andy
Little pick me up?  Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.,6,2,Michael
"Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...",5,13,Dwight
Just now.,1,4,Dwight
"A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",3,16,Michael
Alright... One more time around the block.,5,10,Michael
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.,7,5,Dwight
"Oh wow, these are nice.",7,10,Jim
"Yeah, get them, Creed!",2,22,Dwight
Yes,4,3,Michael
"Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause……",8,2,Andy
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?,3,13,Michael
"Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared.",6,2,Michael
"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",7,11,Michael
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.,4,2,Michael
"I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?",4,4,Dwight
"Lauren, enough with the pencils.",5,2,Michael
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.,5,12,Michael
Well there you go. That's muy caliente.,9,18,Andy
Hello.,2,11,Michael
--to use sudden violence.,3,16,Dwight
"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",2,21,Dwight
"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",5,10,Dwight
"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.",2,14,Michael
"Dwight, what are you drinking?",2,12,Michael
"I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.",5,15,Angela
"Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!",3,22,Andy
What's wrong?,7,14,Pam
"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.",8,18,Kevin
"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.",8,10,Andy
"Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...",2,14,Dwight
Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn’t.  I’m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.,8,5,Andy
"You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.",3,19,Michael
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?,8,12,Andy
"Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.",4,6,Dwight
I don't ... have no idea.,3,7,Dwight
"Message received, little soy bean.",6,7,Andy
Go in single file lines.,2,4,Angela
But he's an idiot!,5,1,Angela
"Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.",7,9,Ryan
"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",2,10,Michael
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.,7,4,Andy
"Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably...",3,20,Jim
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. W.B.,4,10,Andy
No one just called you.,3,2,Dwight
Oh.,3,3,Jim
Put your hands in your pockets.,6,8,Angela
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...,6,15,Ryan
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?,8,23,Jim
"Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?",6,16,Pam
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.,5,1,Darryl
I never said you could do that.,4,12,Michael
Really. It's not a big deal.,8,21,Erin
"Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!",6,15,Erin
"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",8,9,Dwight
"Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.",4,4,Oscar
"And ""I... love you.""",4,14,Michael
"Not enough? I don’t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it’s against the rules but I’m gonna need a favor from you guys.",9,22,Jim
"Ah, show me how this works.",4,5,Jim
You get something good this year?,2,10,Michael
Whether it's this time or next time.,6,17,Jim
"Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.",6,16,Erin
… a measuring cup…,8,16,Erin
"I can't relax about it, you know?",2,19,Kevin
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards.,5,7,Andy
Cheers.,9,18,Pam
I'm not talking to you anymore.,1,3,Pam
Toby!Co-workers Toby! Toby! Toby!,4,14,Michael
Tea.,6,1,Kevin
"No, it's fine.",3,1,Oscar
Oh!,5,9,Jim
"Oh, does he?",4,3,Michael
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.,3,22,Pam
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.,7,24,Erin
"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.",8,14,Dwight
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.,7,13,Kevin
"Alright. Let's clear this up. Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?",6,7,Jim
"Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?",9,6,Dwight
You still do that thing?,3,12,Jim
We didn't break up.,5,5,Michael
"Dwight, please.",7,5,Jim
"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go!",3,21,Michael
Well then. Have a nice day.,3,12,Angela
"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.",2,14,Michael
But what if i'm hungry?,2,19,Dwight
"Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.",8,11,Andy
Lesson learned.,7,12,Pam
Zeke.,9,17,Dwight
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?,3,14,Pam
"Teri's out of town, Michael.",6,1,Phyllis
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.,6,12,Michael
"Great. I am killing it over here. Jim, I gotta go.",9,10,Pam
"Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?",4,3,Angela
"We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says ""Alleluia Church of Scranton."" in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.",5,23,Pam
C.C. me,6,20,Ryan
"Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.",9,14,Erin
I'm gonna answer Charles first.,5,23,Dwight
"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",2,15,Michael
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.,4,11,Ryan
Hey.,3,13,Jim
Australian accent...,8,5,Andy
"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",7,16,Pam
Pam was supposed to get 'em.,2,19,Dwight
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.,8,24,Erin
I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.,2,14,Michael
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.,2,17,Michael
"Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial.",3,20,Kevin
Can we turn this -ing thing around? Thank you.,8,21,Ryan
And I made cookies. Same category.,2,5,Angela
Like a wolf. Thank you.,5,22,Dwight
When do we leave?,8,14,Kevin
"I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.",3,20,Andy
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now… I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.Mr.,8,23,Andy
"I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!",4,8,Andy
"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that’s just sad. If he doesn’t watch himself, he’s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",9,1,Jim
No the other thing.,5,18,Dwight
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.,2,14,Angela
"All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.",6,12,Phyllis
"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",6,15,Andy
"Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.",3,12,Jim
Whoa-- thank you very much.  Oh boy.,6,8,Andy
I hate beet salad.,4,9,Angela
"It's the only time he can do it. 230 to 315. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious.",3,14,Michael
Nah. I play for pleasure.,7,5,Darryl
"Hey, hey.",2,22,Michael
And she is your boss.,2,7,Dwight
"I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...",5,5,Pam
"If the salad is on top, I send it back.",6,5,Michael
"Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?",6,8,Michael
"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",6,22,Michael
Nope.,8,6,Jim
"Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited. But that was then. I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  If that idiot ever gets here.",4,9,Dwight
Yes. And yes.,9,19,Andy
Okay!,2,10,Michael
But check that it's covered by your,6,13,Dwight
I think he's got it!,7,2,Andy
Sure.,3,2,Pam
Helpless.,9,1,Phyllis
"Uh, just a few more items.",5,4,Michael
"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",1,6,Jim
‘Kay.,9,2,Pam
"No, No.",2,3,Michael
"Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.",8,6,Andy
"How about you, man. Comfortable?",3,18,Darryl
Yes.,2,15,Michael
What am I supposed to do with this?,4,9,Angela
Because that is how my mind works.,5,9,Michael
"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",5,2,Jim
Something made of ice?,4,3,Angela
"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?",9,14,Darryl
"Totally, they're the best.",4,14,Oscar
There's gonna be a free room?,6,4,Michael
Wow. What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.,3,13,Michael
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,1,3,Dwight
"No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.",5,11,Andy
"I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.",8,1,Phyllis
Let's do.,6,3,Michael
"Oh, okay.",6,14,Michael
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?,6,20,Erin
"So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.",2,9,Jim

"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that’s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.",9,1,Dwight
Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. And then double it! .,7,13,Kevin
"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.",1,6,Michael
You humiliated me in front of every body!,7,17,Andy
I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.,2,9,Kevin
And they had no yams?,2,12,Michael
"Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to? Not at all. Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this. Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into. What are you gonna do?",4,3,Michael
I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.,5,23,Michael
Thank you.,4,2,Pam
Yeah! Guten Prank number two.,9,23,Jim
What do you think? You've got an hour.,3,19,Dwight
"I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.",8,19,Jim
Check please.,2,7,Michael
How are you doing this?,4,4,Jim
Maybe we have a plan for you?,6,5,Andy
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.,7,1,Oscar
That's what she said.,4,8,Michael
"Hey, nice office.",6,19,Oscar
"Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.",5,11,Dwight
"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",2,11,Michael
"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's ""Nobody's perfect."" Nice stroke, Pam.",8,6,Dwight
Yep. You're being replaced.,5,13,Jim
Where are you taking me?,6,9,Erin
"Oh, I thought it was your mom.",2,6,Jim
Kelly's helping?,2,17,Ryan
I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.,3,23,Ryan
"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed!",6,18,Michael
It was for a video.IT,4,1,Pam
"Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.",2,18,Darryl
All right.,4,9,Michael
Dwight has defeated the computer.,4,3,Andy
Are you stoned?,3,11,Jim
"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?",3,10,Andy
"Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean...",6,6,Jim
Got to be kidding me.,2,10,Jim
"Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.",3,8,Andy
Who is Dr. Perry? I...,3,11,Michael
"Ayyyy!Jim, Pam, Michael and",5,16,Dwight
I wish I had seen you do it.,9,6,Erin
"Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--",7,5,Michael
I didn't know we had a tape measure.,6,16,Erin
"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!",5,15,Michael
It's a fish.,6,7,Michael
Hiding from his momma.Warehouse guys,2,2,Darryl
Pete what?,9,16,Kevin
"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",6,11,Jim
"Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.",6,9,Oscar
"You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.",5,24,Pam
"Hey, everybody, great job. Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.",9,15,Andy
"Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...",3,16,Michael
Paper business.,2,14,Darryl
I don't need to know.,3,10,Pam
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.,1,3,Angela
Thanks T-Dog.,8,2,Andy
There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!,7,21,Michael
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.,8,20,Andy
"A jitterbug. You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?",9,5,Andy
"I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...",5,20,Ryan
Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.,6,8,Jim
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.,4,14,Jim
Da na na na na.,5,5,Michael
Are those the lyrics?,8,15,Kevin
"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",6,23,Michael
"No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.",7,3,Angela
"I can, and I have.",3,19,Michael
"Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?",4,1,Michael
"Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.",8,1,Ryan
"You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don’t, and I will find another buyer.",8,23,Andy
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.,3,12,Dwight
"If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?",6,1,Oscar
Penny for your thoughts.,6,8,Jim
"Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip.",7,21,Michael
"Oh, that could be interesting.",3,16,Jim
What is this called again?,4,7,Michael
But you're the one who picked today.,2,14,Dwight
"No, I don't.",2,2,Michael
I know this is going to be a great payoff.,8,24,Erin
Not classy at all.,5,18,Michael
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.,7,7,Andy
Sure? Okay.,3,13,Andy
Yeah. Thank you.,6,15,Jim
Thank you.,2,2,Pam
"How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!",9,3,Dwight
"Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.",1,6,Dwight
Are you kidding me?,6,15,Michael
"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?",7,14,Ryan
"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.",9,20,Pam
"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",9,16,Dwight
They have business classes there?,3,9,Ryan
"And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.",2,3,Oscar
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.,7,11,Ryan
"Hi, how's it going?",9,16,Andy
...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...,2,1,Michael
"Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.",4,6,Jim
"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.",8,5,Jim
"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. Oh, my God.",2,13,Pam
"No, that's not how I meant it.",2,6,Michael
That's terrible.,2,21,Michael
"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?",3,2,Michael
Hey...,3,18,Jim
"Oh, why do I feel like crap?",3,10,Michael
"Oh, I had a question.",9,21,Pam
"Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-",2,9,Pam
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.,7,17,Jim
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?,6,7,Oscar
"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",5,17,Jim
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,3,7,Dwight
You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.,7,8,Erin
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.,4,13,Michael
"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.",4,2,Jim
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.,9,8,Jim
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,7,6,Michael
"I’m sorry, what?HCT Member #2 I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.",9,5,Andy
I dare you to. Come on.,5,8,Michael
You headed out?,2,3,Pam
"Uh, it's in the lot.Hospital employee Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.",6,16,Jim
"$50,000?",7,2,Oscar
"Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just...",6,11,Michael
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.,2,4,Jim
Because we work together.,7,4,Michael
"What was my worst first date? Umm. It was a couple of years ago. It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's. And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice. Umm, huh. And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else. So, best first date is also my worst first date. Oddly enough.",2,7,Jim
"No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.",1,2,Michael
What's goin' on?,2,14,Kevin
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.,6,23,Erin
"...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.",5,7,Michael
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.,3,13,Phyllis
Look how happy he is.,4,1,Darryl
"That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.",6,16,Michael
I have next meeting!,4,8,Angela
You have big plans for tonight?,7,20,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.",2,4,Jim
"Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.",5,25,Michael
"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.",3,8,Andy
"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.",1,4,Michael
I know.,4,10,Pam
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.,7,23,Kevin
"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. No calls.",2,8,Michael
Nothing.,2,4,Jim
Pam's better at that stuff,5,21,Ryan
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.,2,21,Michael
"Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I’ll hold. I’m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye.",9,19,Andy
I'm really in labor! This is happening!,8,8,Pam
Ah.,6,13,Michael
"The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.",3,10,Michael
"No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...",2,4,Michael
"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.",2,6,Michael
What's wrong with cupcakes?,7,21,Pam
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-,8,11,Dwight
"Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.",3,8,Ryan
"Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says “I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt” unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?",8,14,Dwight
Jim? Pam?,4,9,Michael
"Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?",6,16,Michael
Dripping on me.,5,1,Dwight
I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.,5,3,Pam
"Good, so, we're on the same page?",4,2,Michael
"Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.",5,7,Andy
Ready?!,5,3,Dwight
Yeah?,4,9,Michael
"I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.",7,7,Erin
"Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.",5,3,Michael
Except pass that breathalyzer.,2,2,Jim
Yee.,6,21,Pam
Um...,3,2,Pam
"I guess this could be the one, huh?",7,21,Michael
This is Jim.,6,11,Jim
"Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.",9,8,Dwight
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!,5,22,Dwight
"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",3,4,Michael
"They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.",5,21,Michael
Guys come on. I'm right here.,8,6,Kevin
"Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?",9,4,Jim
"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.",5,8,Michael
"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.",5,24,Michael
Uh hmm.,2,7,Jim
"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.",9,13,Dwight
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...,7,2,Dwight
It's an experiment.,7,21,Angela
Listen to me. I like you so much.,5,5,Michael
"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",7,5,Jim
Mom!Pam's,2,2,Pam
"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",6,15,Michael
"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",6,5,Michael
"Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It’s so great to see you.",9,7,Pam
"Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready?",6,16,Michael
"I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.",3,5,Michael
"Stay out of this, you!",3,12,Dwight
"No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.",9,5,Jim
"Go, go, go, go!",7,1,Andy
"Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.",9,10,Angela
"Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren’t gonna make it.",9,12,Pam
"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?",7,23,Dwight
"It's better, thanks.",1,1,Pam
"No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?",4,11,Jim
"Oh, my God. Dwight.",2,3,Michael
"Hey, don't you have a daughter?",3,17,Pam
"I worked until about 245 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.",4,5,Pam
"They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.",7,12,Michael
I'm going with Pam's group.,6,21,Michael
"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like…not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor…",8,6,Dwight
"Okay, you've got one hour.",5,15,Dwight
Alright. I will definitely do that.,8,10,Jim
"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.",5,11,Pam
We do.,5,16,Jim
"Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.",6,2,Dwight
"Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?",7,7,Phyllis
"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.",6,1,Michael
You're forty-three. Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.,4,2,Oscar
"Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.",9,22,Darryl
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.,4,8,Ryan
Like the witness protection program.,4,4,Michael
"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.",6,18,Dwight
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?,2,22,Pam
You did kill her!?,4,1,Angela
Ok thanks Michael.,4,11,Ryan
"Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.",8,22,Kevin
"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?",3,5,Jim
Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.,5,5,Andy
"It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.",4,5,Ryan
"Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.",8,4,Oscar
"Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.",9,3,Andy
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,2,8,Pam
Absolutely.,6,22,Pam
No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.,4,3,Michael
It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.,4,3,Jim
"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",7,7,Jim
"Michael, can I talk to you a second?",4,2,Ryan
"But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.",6,20,Kevin
No? Then you are an idiot.,3,17,Dwight
"Gettin’ a lot of mileage out of this, aren’t ya?",9,5,Jim
"Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.",3,14,Jim
"Wait, what Holly said?",7,4,Dwight
"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.",3,18,Michael
Dwight we got five strikes.,8,6,Andy
"You could’ve just called that an alliance too, right?",9,13,Jim
My name is Pam.,9,4,Pam
It smells like throw up in here.,6,9,Kevin
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?,3,6,Michael
"OK, forget it.",3,11,Michael
"What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?",9,10,Phyllis
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.,6,23,Andy
Hmm. It wasn't here before.,5,12,Dwight
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!,9,3,Erin
"Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.",3,8,Michael
Yeah. What?,4,4,Michael
"You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.",8,21,Ryan
"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, ""Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney.""",2,14,Michael
"Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?",9,7,Angela
"My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?",8,4,Andy
Stop it.,8,16,Angela
That's your toast?,6,14,Angela
You helped me get off drugs!,7,20,Ryan
"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.",2,1,Dwight
"I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.",3,7,Michael
"Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",5,24,Dwight
Think of it as part of your training.De,7,20,Michael
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!,8,3,Kevin
"Oh, sure thing, go ahead.",6,24,Dwight
You? You haven't made a sale.,3,22,Michael
"I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.",1,5,Michael
"Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.",3,14,Michael
"OK, let’s look at some ties.",8,2,Dwight
"Ah, the old ""leave behind."" Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",7,15,Michael
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.,8,14,Jim
You'll see. Here we go.,9,16,Dwight
There you go.,1,3,Michael
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,2,20,Dwight
"Jo, I think that I know what happened.",6,24,Kevin
"Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.",5,11,Michael
Yeah. But one would be good.,6,14,Michael
Beer me!,3,20,Andy
"Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.",6,4,Pam
Okay.,3,8,Michael
Hey Pack-man.,6,17,Michael
"Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you.",7,22,Dwight
"This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.",5,14,Jim
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.,7,7,Pam
Michael.,4,1,Pam
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.,7,13,Jim
Dwight why don’t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.,8,9,Andy
"Four! Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. All right, here we go!",2,22,Michael
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?,7,24,Andy
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out,8,22,Erin
"Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn. Mr.",5,22,Michael
Hey monkey.,4,1,Dwight
"It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?",2,18,Pam
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.,9,6,Angela
Huh. Maybe I will.,4,12,Pam
Jim! Open the door!,1,3,Dwight
"Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.",4,4,Michael
"Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?",9,10,Erin
Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?,5,21,Pam
"Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?",7,18,Dwight
"Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.",3,18,Darryl
Don't open your eyes.,5,13,Jim
Hm?De,7,21,Michael
"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.",8,6,Pam
"Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.",7,10,Oscar
"Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.",3,9,Andy
Alright.,4,2,Jim
"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",4,4,Jim
You know what? Get Pam.,3,12,Michael
"OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?",3,21,Pam
"Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.",3,22,Jim
How did you...,3,8,Michael
America is one big mall.,7,2,Ryan
"Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?",3,22,Michael
"It's okay, I smell.",7,3,Dwight
I would if I owned it and I went broke.,9,6,Darryl
"I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.",2,14,Michael
"Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! That guy's hilarious. He's here today.",9,14,Erin
"Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. Bus driver Stopping in Tennessee.",7,7,Michael
"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?",6,6,Jim
Cugino's pizza.,2,17,Jim
"Aw, cramp, I'm just-",8,7,Dwight
That fast?,6,24,Pam
He will be ushering you out.,5,24,Michael
"Michael, you're up.",4,9,Andy
"Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate.",6,21,Dwight
"Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...",2,17,Pam
"Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.",7,12,Michael
No problem.,9,15,Jim
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.,9,13,Dwight
"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.",7,22,Dwight
Can you stop this?,6,8,Michael
What? I'm not in love with her.,5,15,Pam
"I know, Kevin.",5,3,Phyllis
"Done, right?",9,9,Jim
Kelly's on your side.,7,24,Oscar
That did. Pretty huge laugh.,7,20,Jim
Your call is very important to us. Ple-,5,20,Kevin
I’ve never met anyone like that.,9,21,Kevin
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?,2,17,Jim
"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.",1,1,Michael
I'm doing my job.,1,1,Dwight
No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.,6,14,Michael
"No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.",8,20,Erin
I'm not talking to you.,5,6,Jim
"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side’s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.",8,1,Andy
"You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.",8,17,Dwight
"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?",5,6,Dwight
That is not big picture.,6,3,Michael
"What a disaster, this whole thing.",4,2,Michael
Okay.,3,23,Michael
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?,2,6,Jim
Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.,2,7,Pam
"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!",2,10,Michael
Table making never seemed so possible.,4,4,Pam
Something wrong with the doll?,5,10,Darryl
I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,5,10,Michael
"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?",8,1,Jim
We'll be here waiting for you.,2,3,Dwight
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.,7,12,Dwight
is a guy that...,3,15,Michael
"Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.",9,7,Phyllis
You promised us whales. These are worms.,7,13,Dwight
"Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.",7,9,Michael
It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question. What kind of bear is best?,3,20,Jim
Phyllis!,9,17,Pam
"Oh, wow!",4,2,Michael
"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.",2,16,Michael
"Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.",3,11,Angela
"He's stealing them. Okay, okay.",5,20,Michael
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!,9,23,Kevin
"Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It’s like air to you people. Ugh, God.",9,7,Dwight
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.,9,20,Pam
And then I inserted my penis-,8,13,Dwight
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.,5,1,Pam
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.,3,21,Pam
I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---,4,4,Michael
"Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.",9,23,Phyllis
"Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",5,16,Michael
I'm not some farm animal.,6,23,Angela
"What, no candy?",6,15,Kevin
I need to talk to you.,5,11,Andy
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.,6,23,Dwight
What?,2,2,Michael
"Michael, look. Missed it...",1,5,Dwight
"Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems. What do I look like to you, Paul Newman? That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face. And I make my own salad dressing. I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian. Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss. I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone but I won't do it.",4,1,Michael
Mmm-hmm. Saunas.,5,1,Michael
I'm sure he'll be fine.,6,16,Erin
"You guys, um, talking Senator?",7,24,Ryan
"It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so it's not too late.",5,16,Michael
This conversation is over.,5,14,Andy
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.,6,6,Michael
Afghani.,2,22,Phyllis
Go ahead and just read the frosting.,9,23,Dwight
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!,7,5,Kevin
"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.",6,23,Andy
Disgusting...,6,6,Phyllis
in the Electric City!,3,8,Dwight
And I lied to you.,9,22,Angela
Does it specify which windshield?,2,8,Dwight
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.,5,23,Michael
Should I clean out my desk?,2,13,Dwight
It was just you...,7,21,Angela
"Alright, alright.",6,19,Michael
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?,9,7,Dwight
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.,5,21,Andy
"I got the surgery, what else is there to do?",8,15,Dwight
"Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?",6,6,Erin
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.,5,26,Jim
Very cool.,5,7,Andy
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.,4,2,Angela
Wow. That was... wow.,3,9,Pam
Did you see this?,9,18,Kevin
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.,5,8,Michael
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?,7,10,Pam
Say hi to the kids.,2,18,Michael
"Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-",8,6,Jim
"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",3,7,Pam
"Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.",8,24,Darryl
"These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?",7,22,Oscar
"Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.",5,5,Pam
Ummm... no idea.,2,8,Jim
Pam? Pam?,7,11,Michael
"You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?",2,5,Michael
How are things?,1,1,Jim
Congratulations.,2,17,Michael
"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.",7,2,Michael
"Ok, alright.",2,9,Michael
It happens occasionally.,2,8,Dwight
"All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said “You can't be a skipper until you're a man.” You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.",9,6,Andy
I'm not good at jokes.,2,14,Dwight
"Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!",2,14,Pam
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.,2,1,Dwight
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.,9,9,Jim
"No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.",5,14,Michael
Do you have a specific place in mind?,5,6,Andy
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!,8,4,Angela
We still surprise each other.,9,2,Pam
"Nope, just going to see Pam.",5,1,Jim
Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.,7,7,Michael
"Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...",7,23,Angela
I just don't get it.,5,4,Dwight
Wow.Kelly's,3,6,Michael
"Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.",6,7,Erin
Oh God-,3,14,Michael
I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.,7,20,Erin
"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.",3,2,Michael
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.,7,5,Jim
I believe in that.,8,20,Andy
"So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.",3,23,Pam
Animation? All her by the way.,4,5,Jim
You forged them! You forged the forms!,7,2,Michael
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?,8,3,Andy
That was the last signature I needed.,5,13,Dwight
"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?",9,15,Kevin
"There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, ""I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu."" See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.",2,21,Michael
Thanks. Today helped.,6,24,Michael
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?,3,13,Jim
We can do that.,7,2,Pam
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?,9,2,Jim
You're the idiot!,3,8,Dwight
Why would I keep you from coming?,7,8,Erin
"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",4,10,Michael
"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",6,24,Andy
Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.,3,19,Dwight
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...,6,6,Dwight
Did she say what it's about?,3,11,Michael
"Back to the Future? Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course. Girl in",4,11,Michael
Just for fun?,2,3,Dwight
What is it? Don't touch it.,9,9,Pam
"The problem with having ""It"" or ""the X-factor"" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.",7,22,Ryan
"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?",4,2,Andy
"Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.",5,11,Andy
"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. J",2,10,Dwight
"And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.",3,11,Michael
"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",3,5,Dwight
Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!,2,12,Michael
"We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?",5,10,Oscar
"You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...",7,3,Andy
"I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.",8,1,Angela
"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.",2,13,Jim
Yeah... maybe.,6,6,Jim
I volunteered for this job.,2,20,Dwight
"Oh, do we? Do ""We?"" Is that what ""we"" want? Why don't ""we"" take a vote on it?",6,12,Michael
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,2,8,Dwight
'Cause Roy's got a truck.,1,6,Pam
I'll leave a message.,5,3,Pam
I'll go.   My name is Deborah U. Tante.  Deb for short.,6,9,Pam
BAT!,3,16,Dwight
"It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.",7,20,Michael
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,2,3,Michael
An alliance?,1,4,Pam
I should make you my vichyssoise.,3,21,Andy
"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",6,16,Pam
"So, uh... Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.",7,9,Dwight
"Hey, Michael.",6,22,Pam
"There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius.",2,14,Kevin
"Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!",7,7,Andy
"You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.",9,10,Erin
I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it -,3,21,Michael
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,8,7,Dwight
Erin Erin...,5,21,Dwight
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,6,23,Andy
"Wait, are they searching all our computers?",6,24,Kevin
"I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.",3,11,Phyllis
"Oh my—! Oh d—! Oh, how did—? Huhhhhh!",9,3,Dwight
What was that?,4,3,Jim
"OK, I accept it.",3,11,Dwight
My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.,5,16,Angela
There you go.,7,20,Michael
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.,7,12,Dwight
Like what?,3,10,Pam
That is the way Southern people talk.,6,9,Michael
"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--",4,12,Dwight
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!,3,16,Dwight
"Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...",5,19,Dwight
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",5,12,Michael
"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.",8,20,Andy
Come in!,4,7,Michael
"Wait, you alright?",6,16,Jim
"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?",4,1,Michael
Alright.De,7,21,Andy
"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",4,9,Michael
Okay.,5,12,Michael
"Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks.",7,17,Erin
Yeah! Tell us a story.,7,24,Kevin
You were supposed to be the Lookout.,6,23,Pam
"Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.",7,13,Michael
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?,4,2,Ryan
Lunch was fine.,6,20,Erin
"Here, let me...",3,15,Michael
"I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!",7,19,Michael
Take me to Robert.,8,11,Dwight
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.,2,3,Michael
"Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.",8,24,Andy
"Oh, Pete, you’ve got mail.",9,2,Erin
I think maybe Hank should be here.,5,19,Michael
I did. I got some really good sleep.,9,20,Erin
I gotcha one.,4,2,Pam
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,6,9,Jim
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!,6,4,Andy
You found Uncle Al!,3,15,Phyllis
"Do you understand, you forced my hand?",6,12,Michael
What's rap?,4,5,Darryl
That marriage would be a sham.,7,18,Michael
That is... who makes that?,2,21,Michael
My priority is safety.,2,15,Darryl
Why is the forklift in the wall?,8,3,Darryl
"I’ve been meaning to join a gym. For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn’t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.",8,9,Darryl
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,6,3,Michael
"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.",3,21,Michael
Hold on one second.,5,17,Jim
"No, no, Toby. No.",2,2,Michael
"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.",6,17,Dwight
Really uncomfortable situation.,9,16,Andy
I should just go.  Where to now Caleb?,6,9,Pam
You knew it.,5,10,Jim
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.,4,4,Pam
Where did you get this?!,7,17,Andy
"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",2,2,Michael
"She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!",3,6,Michael
"Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.",2,19,Michael
"Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",5,23,Michael
"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",6,5,Michael
"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?",4,3,Jim
Thank you. The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.,3,21,Jim
I love it.,5,8,Pam
"No, it was not!",8,8,Dwight
"Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me...",2,9,Jim
OK?,5,3,Michael
Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk.  Oh my God.,3,14,Pam
Then do it.,6,5,Ryan
I think we'll be okay.,6,16,Jim
"“Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA” Dash JH.",8,14,Jim
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,6,21,Pam
"Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-",7,19,Michael
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.,3,14,Michael
"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.",2,5,Michael
"Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that.",6,18,Jim
"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",1,3,Michael
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.,8,9,Andy
"There you go. Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.",8,21,Erin
"Well, is that it? Or?",4,7,Jim
"It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.",6,23,Ryan
"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.",7,11,Dwight
And you guys are okay with this?,6,15,Michael
That was our dream wedding.,7,24,Pam
I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.,6,13,Michael
"Should I... turn, no. Do it again.",1,2,Michael
"Yeah, I will.",4,4,Michael
"Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.",5,12,Jim
We all got to go sometime.,8,7,Kevin
"Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.",6,7,Pam
"Lacrosse, the sport?",4,4,Angela
"There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, ""There's no place like home."" And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? It's gonna drive me crazy.",2,15,Dwight
No. I'm such a dorky dancer.,3,15,Pam
"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.",3,5,Jim
"No, no, no, no, no.",5,6,Michael
I'd love to talk to you about it more.,4,2,Ryan
There's no proof of that.,4,1,Oscar
What are these for?,6,18,Phyllis
So what is the problem?,9,22,Jim
There are over four hundred of these!,7,17,Dwight
It's a new corporate policy.,7,9,Angela
"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",7,11,Pam
Huh. What about Cathy?,8,7,Pam
"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.",6,8,Andy
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!,4,3,Angela
"Okay, listen. I’m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I’ve never actually done this before.",9,19,Dwight
"I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.",4,3,Michael
"Wallace likes Jim. So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks. Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down",4,12,Ryan
"Ok, yes. Sure.",6,19,Michael
I... really want to keep you.,5,2,Michael
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?,5,13,Michael
Mm-hm.,8,19,Jim
"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!",9,10,Dwight
Yes. So do I.,8,20,Erin
"Okay alright. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.",8,16,Jim
My baby is not a monster!,8,14,Angela
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,5,17,Michael
"Oh, some fudge?",9,23,Phyllis
"This is hilarious, but we’re gonna stop with all--",9,8,Jim
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has sex with a unicorn? Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,5,10,Dwight
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,3,2,Jim
Andy— I need to talk to you.,9,19,Dwight
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,6,12,Jim
"Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.",2,18,Michael
"Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!",8,22,Andy

How much did you win?,3,12,Kevin
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.,5,3,Dwight
"Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow.

I think I cut my penis on the lid!,4,6,Dwight
"No. I will not be playing it ""cool"" with Angela. Let me tell you a little story. When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school. Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted. Did I wait, on that list? No, I did not.

Did you know I used to be in HR?,2,12,Michael

"William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""Love doth be poison."" Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.",3,10,Michael

I can't imagine what I would have done.,3,18,Ryan

How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...,1,2,Jim
"Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, ""Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me."" A great boss will say, ""Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.""",2,19,Michael

"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",2,13,Michael
"You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.",7,10,Dwight
"Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.",9,9,Pam
"Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.",1,4,Angela
You're kidding me. Ahh!,7,11,Michael

"Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?",8,4,Andy
"Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",2,11,Michael
"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?",9,14,Jim

Okay.,5,20,Michael
Try it in another sentence.,5,21,Kevin
"OK, well, why are you laying like that?",3,10,Pam
Exactly like this.,9,12,Darryl
Yup.,7,22,Jim
You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.,6,1,Pam
"Oh, which one is decaf?",7,18,Pam
"What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.",6,2,Michael
"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",7,1,Michael
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.,4,2,Michael
"Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.",8,18,Jim
"Thank you, Erin. Woof!",6,24,Ryan
"So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?",3,20,Andy
"OK. Cool, you're on. Don't screw this up.",1,5,Michael
Up and over.,3,8,Michael
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight),8,16,Jim
"I'm pretty good on politics. ""California is bankrupt, and California, California."" What?",7,10,Michael
"Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?",4,3,Jim
I haven't told you about her.,7,11,Michael
I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.,3,18,Michael
"Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting.",5,24,Michael
Holy cow!,8,12,Oscar
Don't even care!,8,18,Dwight
"No, no, no!",3,14,Michael
Saw it.,6,4,Pam
That suit is amazing.,2,19,Dwight
Blonde.,3,14,Jim
"Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?",3,21,Andy
How did you know?,4,14,Michael
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?,2,14,Dwight
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,4,5,Michael
You don't know that.,9,17,Kevin
"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.",7,7,Andy
Let me give you a hand.,6,24,Dwight
Show him how to use it.,7,10,Jim
"The pen delivery went amazing, and now I’ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I’m not one of those people who’s just like, “Uh, sure. I’ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back’s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand… they are just sitting here. Pam didn’t tell me not to unpack them. Don’t want to be a busybody, but I don’t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it’s insane! I’m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I’ve never had an espresso before. They’re good though.",9,11,Erin
Oh... Narcolepsy.,3,10,Dwight
Based…on his merit.,9,23,Dwight
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,2,20,Pam
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is…for…Kevin.,9,23,Dwight
How?,5,15,Michael
"Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.",8,4,Jim
My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?,3,8,Michael
What are you up to? Oops look out!,8,9,Jim
What look?,1,5,Dwight
No. You got that backwards.,5,4,Jim
I think you look nice.,5,22,Phyllis
"Oh, you move on.",4,10,Michael
"Yes, I was watching Jim's face.",4,9,Michael
"Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.",4,8,Dwight
"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",4,12,Michael
"Do you know what ""snap decision"" means?",6,5,Dwight
"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.",8,21,Jim
"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to ""play ball."" Those were his words.",8,11,Andy
"""Hooray. Live it up big D. "" ""Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this""?",7,15,Darryl
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.,3,20,Pam
"They're both single, I have a sense they might-",6,19,Pam
I will allow it.,4,8,Michael
"Yeah, Dwight.",8,4,Andy
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.,7,23,Erin
"Yeah, close one.",3,17,Ryan
"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years.  Years.",2,7,Jim
Hey.Michael Paaam-o-laaaaaa...,5,4,Pam
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --,5,17,Jim
Charge!,8,8,Andy
"Oh, welcome back, Andy.",3,19,Pam
I can't- I can't not touch it.,8,11,Ryan
"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?",2,2,Michael
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.,3,12,Angela
"Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.",4,10,Andy
Nice. Send me a postcard.,2,17,Ryan
"Good morning. Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",4,5,Jim
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.,3,6,Angela
"Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! Oh, here we go.",2,1,Michael
"Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?",9,22,Jim
I'm petrified.,6,16,Kevin
And then another--,6,3,Michael
Hmm...,2,7,Pam
"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",8,10,Andy
Anything else? Flint...,4,7,Dwight
"No, she is the boss.",9,7,Phyllis
"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?",1,4,Michael
"We have good give and take. I give, he takes.",6,21,Pam
Now check the style!,9,4,Andy
Oh this is a good one.,1,2,Michael
Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,4,2,Michael
Awesome.,6,12,Kevin
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.,4,4,Michael
Why's it smell real? Ah... good one.,7,11,Jim
Wait. Are you saying...,9,14,Dwight
"No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.",2,13,Michael
This dance competition is not over.,5,25,Andy
To intimidate my subordinates.,3,23,Dwight
Why would you start so high?,6,12,Jim
I'll kill you man!,4,6,Michael
"You’re the Quizno’s. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn’t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?",9,7,Dwight
We're done. We're done!,7,20,Michael
No.,6,4,Michael
"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",6,10,Michael
"Oh no, they're still not done.",7,21,Phyllis
"Yeah, punch him.",5,8,Ryan
Can I go?,2,17,Jim
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.,2,17,Jim
"That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god.",9,4,Jim
"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",4,13,Michael
Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this shot. Aaannnddd go!,4,3,Andy
"I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.",8,12,Erin
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.,8,3,Kevin
"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?",2,13,Michael
"Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson.",3,22,Michael
Morning Dwight.,6,8,Michael
"Answer me this, though.",2,4,Dwight
"Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?",2,9,Pam
"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.",2,3,Jim
Hot!,9,22,Phyllis
"Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?Mee",7,7,Jim
"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.",8,12,Andy
Do you want me to help you with that?,2,10,Pam
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?,8,24,Pam
"That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.",2,14,Michael
Here's a question nobody's asking Is this worth it?,7,11,Oscar
Door. Chair. It’s about Phillip.,9,22,Dwight
"Yeah, my boudoir's always open.",6,9,Erin
What are you talking about? Yes we can.,8,20,Pam
"All right, Meredith.",9,22,Oscar
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.,3,22,Andy
No way.,7,11,Jim
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.,6,21,Ryan
"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?",8,13,Dwight
Rrrah!,8,18,Dwight
That's impossible.,9,6,Dwight
"Umm, on the contrary.",3,8,Andy
I didn't want to miss it.,7,11,Erin
"Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.",2,5,Michael
"Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...",4,3,Michael
"Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!",1,5,Michael
Let me see.,7,10,Dwight
Irie.,4,8,Michael
"So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...",4,9,Michael
All right. Are you okay?,2,1,Dwight
MR. JAMES HALPERT!,8,4,Dwight
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,4,12,Pam
That doesn't exist anymore.,2,22,Jim
That's actually a test prep book.,2,4,Ryan
Mmhmm.,4,2,Michael
"You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.",6,19,Andy
It's early bird gets the worm.,3,17,Dwight
"Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?",7,19,Oscar
"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",2,8,Michael
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,6,4,Michael
Good. What? Nothin',8,1,Jim
"Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.",5,20,Michael
"Michael, that seems impossible.",5,20,Pam
I don't want anyone to die.,6,16,Erin
"Okay. This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.",5,13,Michael
"Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.",5,25,Michael
"Andy, would you like to have my baby?",5,3,Michael
"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it’ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!",9,1,Andy
Dwight Schrute is manager!,9,21,Dwight
"I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.",6,10,Oscar
Okay. Watch my toes.,8,12,Kevin
"Oooooh, my life!",3,19,Michael
I will not.,8,13,Angela
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!,5,21,Michael
"I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.",9,16,Pam
"Yes, I did, for you, princess. Even though I only went number one. I didn't really wash my hands. Ohhh, what have we here? This looks delicious.",4,9,Michael
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.,3,15,Michael
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,6,3,Michael
"Thanks, man.",9,22,Darryl
"Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.",8,22,Ryan
Whoa. Who is this guy?,8,20,Jim
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.,5,24,Pam
"Ok, well we'll see about that.",9,16,Andy
"Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.",2,7,Ryan
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?,2,20,Michael
"You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry!",2,9,Phyllis
Are you kidding me?,7,3,Michael
"Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?",2,8,Michael
"What... can I do, for you?",3,20,Michael
Stop it! Stop it!,5,6,Michael
I will.,6,8,Dwight
"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.",2,5,Dwight
Stop. Don't. Just...,6,1,Pam
You can make people believe anything. Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups. Why? I don't know. I don't have to know. That's what makes me so dangerous.,3,21,Andy
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.,2,15,Michael
"That was like, ten years ago.",7,4,Jim
"Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! Gimme the bottle!",2,12,Michael
It has the birth song on it!,6,16,Pam
It wasn't so bad.,9,18,Pam
"A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",2,21,Michael
"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",7,15,Jim
"Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? ""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem."" This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.",3,11,Michael
Gosh.,1,3,Jim
Let's go. Pick up a paddle.,4,8,Pam
Kay.,2,4,Pam
"No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.",4,11,Jim
"Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.",3,23,Michael
Mm-hmm. Good safe?,9,8,Dwight
It's like a haunted disco.,5,25,Andy
You don’t carry it with you?,9,8,Angela
I like working here.,8,19,Pam
"I know, I do.",8,9,Jim
"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",4,5,Michael
"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-",2,8,Michael
"I bet I should. That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.",8,12,Jim
Let's send up Accounting.,2,14,Michael
"I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",3,3,Michael
"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!",3,4,Michael
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.,3,22,Ryan
Mmhm.,6,5,Michael
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.,9,5,Pam
Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?,4,9,Pam
Somebody's found the hog maw.,9,9,Dwight
"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",7,16,Michael
I'll just leave it here with you.,6,12,Oscar
"Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.",5,14,Pam
You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.,4,3,Phyllis
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?,8,17,Dwight
"Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.",5,26,Dwight
"Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!",5,18,Michael
"Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?",6,7,Phyllis
"So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...",7,24,Erin
Alright...,4,3,Jim
"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.",8,14,Dwight
Andy! Leapfrog!,6,1,Dwight
"He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.",5,16,Phyllis
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?,6,20,Erin
"Oh, but, hey, Jim.",3,12,Pam
That is so unnecessary!,5,18,Angela
"Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.",9,20,Dwight
"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.",3,5,Pam
"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. Watch, watch, watch, watch. Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?",3,10,Andy
Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.,6,17,Michael
"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.",3,10,Pam
"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",6,24,Michael
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...,3,11,Pam
"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",1,3,Michael
I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...,6,22,Andy
Where did you save the list of exchanges?,3,11,Phyllis
"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?",3,11,Jim
"Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.",8,12,Erin
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,6,22,Michael
"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",3,9,Jim
"Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.",3,16,Jim
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.,3,19,Michael
Hey! Wanna play hookey today?,9,15,Erin
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.,2,10,Kevin
You got really sunburned.,9,15,Erin
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?,3,12,Andy
"I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why?",9,6,Oscar
Dwight's car is gone.,8,6,Erin
Yes.,5,15,Michael
That was a good example.,1,4,Pam
"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.Business Student #2 But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?",3,16,Michael
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?,6,4,Kevin
Yeah.,4,14,Michael
Where?,9,21,Dwight
"I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?",4,1,Angela
You. Us.,5,24,Ryan
"Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.",6,19,Michael
"No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",5,8,Jim
"Dwight, Dwight.",2,1,Jim
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.,4,3,Angela
It’s by the tenderloin.,9,19,Dwight
Jim said that?,6,11,Kevin
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.,5,23,Jim
"Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. Get back... Back to work!",3,11,Dwight
"Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...",2,5,Ryan
"I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!",8,10,Erin
"TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!",7,4,Dwight
"Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.",6,4,Dwight
"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.",7,7,Pam
"Five, four, three, two...",4,12,Dwight
"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?",8,12,Kevin
That it'll be the first shipment out today.,8,8,Erin
Okay that's enough.,3,4,Phyllis
"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.",4,8,Pam
"Say ""Me eat cookie.""",6,20,Phyllis
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years….and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.,8,2,Andy
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works.,6,3,Andy
"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",4,4,Michael
"Good. Very good. Oh—no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. “New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.” And then in parentheses, he wrote out “as soon as possible.”",9,3,Pam
I thought you guys couldn’t come.,9,23,Dwight
"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.",2,8,Michael
Don't tell them we have free delivery!,5,21,Michael
"No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...",3,23,Michael
Yes. Right now? Yes.,8,6,Jim
What's up?,3,8,Pam
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.,3,2,Michael
"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",8,12,Jim
"Oh, we're in a meeting.",4,8,Phyllis
"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?",2,7,Oscar
"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.",7,15,Michael
"Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!",3,19,Michael
"In the picture, are you high?",3,11,Jim
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.,7,13,Andy
Yes.,5,17,Michael
Dry rot?,4,2,Dwight
We heard it.,3,8,Michael
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.,8,12,Jim
"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.",7,12,Jim
Unreal.,4,11,Ryan
I can.,6,8,Jim
"No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.",2,22,Michael
No thanks I'm stuffed.,3,3,Dwight
Next to the IHOP?,5,3,Kevin
So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation.,7,21,Michael
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?,5,5,Pam
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,3,5,Dwight
She...,3,9,Jim
"He said, we have been sold.",6,12,Michael
"I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn’t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid…wonderful…boring…amazing job.",9,23,Jim
I don't like that.,6,4,Jim
Doesn't matter.,1,6,Dwight
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.,6,15,Dwight
I’m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it’s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.,8,1,Andy

Would that be such a bad thing?,4,14,Dwight

I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.,8,14,Erin
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,4,3,Pam
"No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. Take care of that, all right?",4,14,Michael
"Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?",8,22,Andy
He's searching out younger gays.,8,24,Dwight

Where's the bug?,8,16,Dwight
"Oh man! I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...",6,12,Dwight
"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",7,24,Dwight
"Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.",5,23,Phyllis
"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! Nice, huh?",2,10,Michael

Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.,6,7,Michael
"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",6,22,Andy
"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.",4,5,Michael
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -,6,14,Oscar

Email forwards.,2,2,Angela
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.,8,4,Ryan
"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.",6,11,Andy

"Bye, Dwight.",9,12,Jim
Oh yeah. What else you got?,6,4,Erin
"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... we'll see what Rosa comes back with.",7,24,Andy
Have you?,4,14,Pam
Thanks for having me.,6,14,Michael
"Who should it come from, then?",5,11,Michael
How is that a bad rumor?,6,1,Angela

K,5,25,Andy
"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.",7,1,Erin

"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",4,4,Pam
"Paranoid? I’m not familiar with the word. And I really don’t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.",9,1,Dwight
Exactly. You can do this.,7,5,Jim
How can you do that to me?,4,8,Michael
"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.",9,1,Pam
What's going on? Do you know that guy?,7,13,Pam
Alright.,6,7,Jim
"Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?",9,4,Pam
"Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.",7,14,Jim
Thanks old man.,5,17,Dwight
"You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.",5,14,Michael

What lab did these little clones escape from?,9,5,Dwight
"Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.",5,8,Michael
Blue's not a flavor.,1,6,Michael
With gift baskets.,4,2,Ryan
"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.",5,12,Michael
"So long, Stanley!",7,6,Dwight
"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?",7,1,Michael

Why would I wanna do that?,6,15,Jim

"Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!",6,9,Dwight
"But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",3,22,Michael
"Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.",5,19,Michael
"Go! Oh, that's nice.",7,12,Michael
Call him! Call him!,9,18,Angela
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.,4,1,Pam

I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one ""Holly, you and I are soup snakes."" The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.",5,26,Michael
Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.,3,12,Michael
La telefona.,6,21,Michael

We will demonstrate on Pam.,3,14,Michael
"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",6,16,Michael

Yep.,9,18,Jim
"I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.",8,3,Andy
"You know, selling, typing, dialing.",3,5,Dwight
"When people see this presentation, they’re gonna in their pants.",8,17,Ryan

You apologize right now.,7,11,Dwight
"Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this.

How pleasant. You can...,2,8,Michael
"Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.",2,4,Dwight

I don't either.,6,8,Michael
"I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.",6,1,Michael
"I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy.

"I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.",2,15,Angela

"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",6,4,Michael
"Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?",8,7,Darryl

"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",2,13,Jim
"No, you don't...",3,6,Ryan
Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?,6,4,Pam
Why not call...,8,20,Dwight
"Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner?",3,8,Jim

"Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.",2,13,Dwight
"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",8,12,Andy
"And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.",1,2,Dwight
"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.",2,12,Michael
... It's a million-dollar sale.,5,6,Michael
Yeah?,6,7,Michael
"Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?",5,6,Jim
"Oh, great. ""Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy."" Oh that's not good.",8,20,Jim
"Again, that gives us no information.",6,3,Oscar

So how much antigravity potion do you want?,4,14,Pam
"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",3,4,Pam

"I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time.

"So Darryl says to me “fire me”. But what he really means is “I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.” So I say “No, you're not fired.” But what I really mean is “I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.”........I really hope that's what he and I mean.",8,3,Andy

"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy.

He sucked.",1,1,Michael

From the downsizing.,1,4,Dwight

Please go back to your desk.,3,3,Pam
"Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.",3,3,Michael

With my leads and stuff like that?,9,1,Dwight
I do not understand what you spend your money on.,2,3,Michael
That’s a lot of pros.,9,22,Jim
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.,3,22,Michael

"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",1,1,Michael
Action.,3,14,Dwight

"Our theme, if you will.",5,15,Dwight

"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",2,15,Michael
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.,6,18,Dwight
"We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.",5,7,Andy
Sorry about that. What'd I miss?,6,2,Michael
Wag.,5,20,Kevin

Close it.,7,18,Andy
"Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat.  Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--",5,24,Michael
Because it's very scary stuff.,2,5,Michael
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,3,5,Michael
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.,8,7,Dwight
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.,5,25,Pam
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?,9,18,Phyllis
Once point for me.,2,6,Pam
I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.,3,21,Michael
"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.",5,21,Pam
"Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.",3,17,Michael
Quiz me up.,2,4,Michael
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.,6,7,Jim
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.,3,10,Michael
"I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?",2,14,Michael

Okay. All right.,6,17,Michael
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?,9,16,Dwight
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,3,7,Dwight
"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",6,22,Andy
"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",6,15,Pam
We know that.,8,2,Jim
"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",2,11,Michael
"What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?",1,5,Michael
"Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.",8,23,Dwight
"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, ""this way, this way""?",7,14,Dwight

You give up?,5,11,Andy
I was after your money.,6,21,Pam
"Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?",5,24,Michael
All right.,5,24,Michael
Haho!,8,6,Erin
"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.",6,10,Michael
What are you thinking?,6,6,Andy
Ah... busted. Yes,5,19,Andy
"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",5,13,Michael
Never say that.,9,4,Erin
"Kevin, come.",5,25,Angela

"No, thanks. I'm good.",2,2,Jim
Birthday punches! One two three four five sice seven eight!,7,15,Andy
"Actually, I had mine already.",2,8,Ryan
"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",3,21,Michael
Call a doctor.,5,25,Phyllis
"Aw, I missed you.",8,18,Pam
Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.,6,21,Kevin
"Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.",5,14,Andy
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.,3,10,Michael
"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together.",2,8,Jim

Hey-oh!,5,1,Andy

"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So... Pam's",2,2,Pam
"Good luck, Dwight.",2,22,Angela
"Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.",6,24,Jim
"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",6,22,Dwight
"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",2,10,Jim
"Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",6,24,Michael
I won't.Mr.,1,2,Michael
I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.,6,15,Dwight
Yeah. Did you not see it?,7,15,Erin
Jan knows paper.,7,4,Dwight
Just forget it.,2,13,Michael
"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",6,5,Oscar
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.,3,9,Michael
Kevin Malone.,2,10,Kevin
"No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it’s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.",9,3,Andy
"Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny ""Jim"" game.",7,14,Pam
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.,7,18,Michael
Fine! Have your party. Just no guests.,3,10,Michael
It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now.,6,1,Pam
"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?",6,23,Michael
"Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?",1,4,Jim
"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",7,11,Michael
"Just do it, okay?",3,2,Michael
That is not the way I heard it.,6,3,Michael
"Um, um, um...",3,2,Michael
"Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!",4,1,Michael

It's outside.,5,10,Angela
"Hey, I did good too!",5,6,Phyllis
"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",8,9,Dwight
"I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-",9,20,Andy
Just admit you lost track of time.,6,15,Dwight
"Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win.",8,18,Dwight
I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.,1,4,Michael
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.,8,1,Andy
"Oh! Can I be Australian, mate?",3,20,Kevin
"Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.",5,13,Michael
That was cold.,4,4,Darryl
"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I’m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",9,13,Jim
He’s fine.,8,2,Oscar
"Could you just say, ""these are due back Thursday""?",4,12,Kevin
"Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!",2,12,Michael
"Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...",5,20,Michael
"Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.",7,3,Phyllis
What? I believe it.,1,4,Dwight
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?,2,3,Dwight
"We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.",6,19,Andy
"She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.",3,20,Andy
Kelly has an eating disorder?,6,1,Erin
"So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",6,16,Jim
Are you talking about Beverley?,4,10,Pam
Maybe you should call back?,9,22,Pam
"Oh, Michael.",5,15,Pam
"You’ll always have the upper hand, when you’ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.",9,22,Dwight
What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.,2,4,Kevin
"Alright everybody, you are doing great!",8,6,Andy
Let's do it! Drop that sucker.,3,19,Michael
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.,8,10,Jim
To throw you off the scent.,2,11,Michael
I didn’t do anything any of you wouldn’t have done.,8,17,Andy
I'm digging.,5,1,Michael
"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.",5,16,Pam
"Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.",5,1,Phyllis
"Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.",7,18,Dwight
"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?",8,14,Dwight
Aaah!,7,2,Dwight
"Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...",3,8,Jim

I... why don't we go back to this animation.,4,5,Jim
Okay.,5,24,Michael
Oh zip it.,2,16,Kevin
"Yeah, okay. Well this is gonna hurt like a mother.",7,20,Michael
"Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in… March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so…",8,16,Jim
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...,1,4,Michael
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,5,8,Michael
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.,6,14,Michael
"Oh, you idiot.",2,5,Michael
"I learned a lot about women today. And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Jan and I broke up. Why? Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail? But that is her peariagative. I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.",3,21,Michael
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.,8,5,Phyllis
It’s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.,8,7,Darryl
"Sad, something to break.",7,12,Michael
"The building’s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we’re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.",9,2,Pam
"After 16 years, it’s strange sitting across from somebody who isn’t Stanley. But…he’ll get there.",9,23,Phyllis
"Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.  It was hysterical.",2,14,Michael

"Oh, tell me, tell me.",1,4,Pam
"Nyeh, I work here. Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",2,19,Michael
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?,2,17,Pam
"Okay, this is much worse than before.",7,15,Oscar
Messages?,1,1,Michael

Which is?,2,17,Dwight
My eyes!,2,12,Dwight

"So, what do you do?",6,19,Michael
No no no no. I like her.,8,2,Darryl
"Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you’re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.",8,3,Darryl
"Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.",3,13,Michael
"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look?",9,23,Dwight
"Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.",2,13,Pam
I don't want -,4,5,Jim
What did you end up with?,2,10,Oscar
"Packer's giving one. Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.",8,15,Erin
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.,2,21,Michael
"Yeah, I do. My word against yours.",7,14,Michael
"""A7557962."" Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.",2,18,Jim
"Oh no, I’m fine.",8,7,Pam
"About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am. I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim...",2,22,Pam
"Oh, great. So we’ll see somebody else’s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it’s really not that hard to film a video.",9,12,Jim
"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.",6,21,Jim
But I didn't report your snoring-,2,21,Phyllis
I heard a joke today.,4,2,Angela

Is that Chet Montgomery?,2,18,Oscar
You’ve gotta be kidding me.,8,17,Oscar
"Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.",2,16,Phyllis
No. Wholesies.,3,21,Dwight
"Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.",9,3,Dwight
"Give-okay. Alright, give it up.",7,1,Michael
We don't need luck.,4,2,Michael
"And the ""Tight Ass"" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down.",2,1,Michael
"19, serving 4.",4,8,Darryl
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?,8,24,Darryl
"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",4,10,Michael
I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.,6,20,Darryl
If you don't mind me asking---,5,7,Oscar

Go ahead. Don't lie.,2,20,Dwight
That's exactly what Wallace told us.,6,3,Jim

Pretty amazing.,6,17,Jim
"Ok, so we're on the same page, great.",5,18,Michael
Mmm.,6,21,Michael
"Hi, Pam, hello.",9,16,Pam
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.,9,4,Jim
"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.",9,1,Andy

"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.",2,6,Dwight
Pretty nice.,4,13,Michael
I didn't give you $40.,3,18,Michael
"This is gonna be good. To whom it may concern. Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. The dictionary defines superlative as of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. Ohhh, yeah.",7,21,Dwight
We're together.,4,2,Pam
"You can't yell out ""I need this, I need this"" as you pin down an employee on your lap!",6,12,Jim

"There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.",7,2,Pam
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.,2,14,Michael
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.,2,7,Jim
All right. This is gonna be good.,1,6,Michael

Try 'Control P'.,7,10,Michael
That is a good point.,2,1,Michael
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?,6,19,Dwight
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,6,23,Michael
You did that for me?,5,8,Ryan
Do it!,7,8,Pam
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,2,20,Dwight

Good.,3,23,Michael
"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",4,10,Dwight
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch,6,9,Dwight
"Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",6,1,Andy

"I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.",3,19,Michael
"I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... Kids love candy bars.",3,16,Michael
About Julie?,6,19,Jim
Can I turn on the radio?,5,14,Pam
"Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!",3,22,Andy
"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. Okay.",2,5,Michael
"OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-",9,2,Pam
Ew! Oh.,9,10,Angela
"Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.",9,10,Jim
Uh oh. She's doing it again.,9,18,Kevin
Did you go to second?,2,8,Jim
You are the master.,5,6,Dwight
This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.,7,3,Michael
"Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.",3,16,Michael
"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",9,15,Dwight
"Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.",8,3,Kevin

Nice job.,4,10,Pam
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.,9,18,Dwight
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.,6,14,Michael
It's the nativity scene.,5,10,Angela
"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.",4,4,Michael
"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.",2,16,Michael
"Oh, my God.",3,21,Pam
"No, I don't know.",4,4,Dwight
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!,7,1,Erin
"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",8,13,Pam
"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired."" ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so...",1,4,Michael
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.,7,9,Phyllis
"Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!",7,12,Dwight
So check out how we live,6,13,Michael
Do you ever miss us?,4,11,Michael

"And here we have ""Mister Roger's Neighborhood."" Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.",1,5,Michael
"Well, we are running a business, so.",3,9,Michael
"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?",2,12,Pam
"That's tasteless, Gabe.",7,14,Oscar
"What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!",9,7,Andy
A single piece of pepperoni please.,7,8,Dwight
"No, no, dude, no.",1,4,Jim
"I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.",5,6,Michael
Just tell her the real reason.,7,6,Jim
"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",2,11,Michael
"So, what do you say we get started?",5,20,Pam
What happened to Phyllis?,5,25,Oscar
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,5,17,Michael
You look great.,6,4,Jim
I...,3,11,Michael
"Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.",4,3,Ryan
"It just feels a little bit, like...",3,10,Jim
I saw him two minutes ago.,3,21,Jim
"I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.",5,2,Michael

"Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?",2,12,Dwight
"Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.",6,6,Michael
That... that's impossible.,7,18,Dwight
"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.Pizza guy The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.",4,3,Michael
"Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.",6,20,Michael
I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.,6,16,Pam
You know what? I could use a little help.,5,15,Jim
"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.",3,4,Dwight
"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",3,12,Andy
Yeah. How was it?,3,11,Kevin
"Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.",7,7,Michael

Damnit! Damnit Jim!,1,3,Dwight
"I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.",3,16,Dwight
"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",2,10,Michael
"I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.",6,16,Pam

It's an investment.,2,4,Ryan
I am not gonna do this.,5,19,Jim
"Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?",9,7,Pam

"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.",7,1,Dwight
Gimli.,1,5,Dwight

Hmm hmm.,3,10,Angela
"Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.",3,17,Michael
How's your fart project coming?,7,12,Kevin
This is awesome!,6,20,Andy
"Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states. Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo. Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter. And Denise proves that with every party she throws. Oh, and Denise? Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly. We all know you get perms.",4,3,Angela
What do I have to live for?,3,19,Michael
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.,2,3,Dwight
"Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.",8,16,Oscar
So this is the dream team.,7,21,Pam
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.,2,19,Angela
"It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.",6,15,Erin
"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.",2,6,Michael

Let's just calm down.,7,1,Pam
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?,2,11,Michael
Heart is. That makes a lot more sense. You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? I think not!,3,23,Michael
Okay.,6,21,Michael
"Okay, Jim.",4,6,Dwight
"Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.",4,4,Oscar
"If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.",5,11,Dwight
Be good.,5,7,Angela
"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...",4,12,Michael

You don't even drink tea.,2,10,Jim
"No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",4,7,Michael
"So, there was talk of oatmeal.",8,10,Kevin
I miss her so much.,9,17,Dwight
"Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",3,10,Pam
No. These s'mores are disgusting.,3,6,Michael
"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?",5,16,Michael
"Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.",6,6,Phyllis
"I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.",5,6,Andy

I guess I could be nicer.,5,22,Kevin
"Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?",9,3,Phyllis

Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.,3,14,Angela
"Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.

Hold on one second. Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?,4,2,Ryan
"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, ""This might be kinda fun."" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",1,5,Michael

Okay.,2,19,Michael
Leave the keys!,3,12,Dwight

"Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.",7,19,Angela
"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.",2,10,Michael

Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.,5,14,Andy
"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.",1,6,Dwight
"Welcome back, Stanley.",8,20,Pam

"Oh, what did you do today?",6,19,Michael
"How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.",7,20,Ryan
It's ridiculous.,4,11,Angela
As in...,9,3,Andy
I've been warned.,4,10,Pam

Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.,3,23,Dwight
"No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time. This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out. Enjoying friends, all being the same. Worker bees.",2,9,Michael

"TMI. Too much information. I used to say, ""Don't go there,"" but that is so lame now. Or, ""You go, girl."" Or... Um, when did ""Where's the beef?"" That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, ""Too much information"" probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.",2,1,Michael
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.,3,8,Ryan

Nurse.,4,1,Michael
"What's the um, saying, ""once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just...

"You and your wife, and you have kids.",1,6,Michael
"I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place.",6,11,Michael

"Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me.

"Oh my gosh, now she's up.",3,10,Dwight

My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment. Like... the moon landing. Or Vietnam. Rolling Stones. Greatest band ever.,4,2,Michael
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.,9,22,Andy
"You should, you should put out salt for the rims",3,10,Phyllis

"Okay, we should go now. Let’s go.",9,7,Angela
"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",8,14,Jim

If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.,3,8,Dwight
Should you really be so blatant about that?,7,24,Pam
Mmhmm.,7,11,Michael
"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.",2,12,Michael

You still want to have a party?,1,4,Pam
"It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place. Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...",4,9,Michael
"David, how much did this house cost?",3,17,Michael
"Michael, you make fun of us every day.",6,7,Phyllis
Yes. I said that yesterday.,6,4,Michael
This is the Nard-Dog.,5,14,Andy
"That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.",5,8,Michael
"Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?",2,10,Phyllis
"I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.",4,14,Pam
Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,3,4,Dwight
Carol used to drink lattes.,3,10,Michael
That was not scripted.,7,16,Michael
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.,9,13,Jim
"Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? No one.",3,11,Michael
"How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?",6,7,Erin
I thought that was your corner.,5,21,Pam
"Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don’t squash my knickety-knacks on top.",9,21,Andy
Consider yourself... at home!,5,4,Andy
"Here, right there. Down the hatch.",8,13,Andy
That's not different enough.,4,5,Andy
"I’m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it’s like a double date.",9,21,Pam
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,2,15,Michael
"Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",3,12,Michael
"No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.",9,14,Angela
"It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.",4,14,Jim
"Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.",5,14,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!",8,1,Jim
"So, there was no sales call.",4,6,Pam
I do too.,5,22,Michael
"How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger. Kevin &",5,6,Michael
"Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he’ll be calling in any second.",9,12,Jim
"Books! Excellent, Jim.",8,11,Andy
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.,8,4,Oscar
"Yes, Sensei!",2,6,Dwight
I never went to Thailand.,5,23,Ryan
Excellent.,2,1,Michael
"Hey, it's 1220; where the hell's Dwight?",2,8,Michael
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.,2,5,Michael
"Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.",5,25,Michael
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.,6,7,Dwight
Work.,5,25,Phyllis
"That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.",2,21,Jim
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,3,4,Michael
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.,7,6,Oscar
You could ask for an extension.,2,4,Dwight
"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.",8,14,Dwight
Hey Andy.,7,10,Darryl
Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.,2,8,Angela
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.,5,25,Michael
"Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.",5,13,Jim
"Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my chubby daughter?",8,18,Darryl
"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.",2,3,Pam
"Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.",2,2,Michael
"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",8,20,Pam
"It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.",6,16,Jim
When I say it out loud it's so silly.,5,25,Phyllis
"My respect. Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -",6,19,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.",1,2,Dwight
You know what? I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.,5,4,Michael
"No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.",5,1,Pam
"Come on, Pam.",2,4,Phyllis
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.,5,1,Oscar
"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...",3,3,Dwight
"No!! Come on, gimme something good!",4,12,Michael
I hate it! I hate your car!,7,8,Erin
'Scuse me?,3,6,Jim
Jim.,8,13,Pam
"Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.",3,23,Michael
"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.Mr. O'",2,2,Michael
Do you have the Sharpie?!,5,3,Dwight
Gah!,5,1,Dwight
"I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!",5,1,Michael
"This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",6,4,Michael
Maybe more.,2,8,Pam
"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it.",3,19,Darryl
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.,6,20,Jim
"Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.",5,22,Andy
We're gonna stay.,5,25,Jim
"Hey! Right back atcha, bitch!",7,12,Kevin
"Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.",7,12,Michael
Really? Because your mother is dead.,8,7,Erin
I drove.,5,18,Michael
There’s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales…,8,2,Andy
"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",4,7,Jim
Come on. Tell me.,3,5,Pam
"Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.",2,12,Pam
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.,3,20,Pam
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.,7,5,Dwight
Mmm. Okay.,4,5,Michael
"Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.",3,23,Kevin
You make a very compelling argument.,3,18,Michael
"Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines ""wedding"" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride ""Mawige...",3,15,Michael
"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",3,5,Pam
"And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?",9,5,Angela
Yeah?,5,9,Michael
Like this? Watch.,9,19,Dwight
Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.,6,11,Michael
"Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.",4,14,Michael
"Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! No deal. Not with Michael Scarn, FBI. Michael Scarn doesn't make deals. Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later.",2,9,Michael
Well that's Dallas.,7,18,Andy
"Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.",8,6,Darryl
"See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.",1,6,Michael
It involves you too.,6,18,Jim
"Something came for you, Michael.",6,18,Erin
"Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'",6,5,Ryan
"Really? That's kind of a big client. Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",5,17,Michael
We heard about the punch.,6,8,Ryan
"Oh, I'll help you find it.",3,8,Phyllis
"No, I didn’t notice anything.",8,2,Jim
"Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....",8,10,Andy
"You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... ""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",1,4,Michael
That's an exaggeration.,6,5,Dwight
"You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael’s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I’m so not prepared.",9,5,Andy
"Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.",6,16,Ryan
"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",9,14,Pam
...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking...,2,3,Michael
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes!,3,22,Michael
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-,9,2,Pam
"Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.",3,2,Michael
Want to take a rake... .,2,12,Dwight
What are you reading?,3,16,Jim
"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...",5,8,Jim
Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.,6,8,Pam
Get in!,5,6,Dwight
True. Meredith.,2,6,Jim
"I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.",5,4,Andy
"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",6,3,Michael
"It's just out there, you...",2,6,Pam
"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",9,14,Jim
"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.",1,1,Jim
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.,6,5,Oscar
"No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.",4,2,Ryan
"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",7,1,Michael
"When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking ""I'm a little too old for this."" And I was five.",3,4,Ryan
"Hi Jan, you look... tan.",3,11,Kevin
Heh.,8,24,Angela
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,5,13,Michael
You wanna go?,4,4,Andy
"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef’s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won’t work. That’s no good.",9,23,Dwight
"Hi. No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?",4,8,Michael
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.,7,5,Kevin
Bail'er? I hardly know her.,3,19,Michael
"Oh, come on! Do you see this? Disgusting.",5,8,Pam
"Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",8,13,Pam
"Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, Danny Cordray! Danny couldn't be here tonight...",7,20,Michael
"Dwight! Stop it!  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.",4,6,Michael
I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?,5,2,Kevin
"Thanks, Phyllis. Yours, too.",4,12,Pam
"There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?",9,2,Jim
Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.,4,11,Michael
"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?",8,4,Jim
"You are never going to be my father, you get out!",6,6,Pam
"Good for you, man. Good for you.",6,23,Ryan
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  What's that?,5,19,Andy
Pie! Pie! Pie!,9,4,Jim
That's what she said. Pam?,2,2,Michael
"Aw, that’s cute.",9,19,Andy
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—,9,22,Jim
"Hey, what about Angela?  She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.",3,1,Michael
"That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!",4,5,Michael
What happened? Did you miss your bus?,9,9,Pam
There's a plan.,7,12,Pam
"Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...",5,1,Jim
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.,7,5,Jim
"Oh, Robert, you're horrible. Simon, Maxine. Who let you guys in here?",9,14,Angela
"Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.",9,4,Andy
"You know, I would like to try the luge, through.",7,19,Michael
You have never been cooler.,9,9,Dwight
This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don’t lie. I can tell if you’re lying.,9,13,Dwight
"Ok, I said average.",3,5,Jim
Warning! Warning! Warning!,8,1,Kevin
"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.",6,9,Dwight
No I think you explained it.,9,18,Pam
"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --",8,17,Jim
"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. We will let you know.",7,24,Jim
"I knew that, I knew it.",8,13,Oscar
Did you guys figure it out?,8,1,Angela
"Come on Angela, don't you have a game?",2,3,Pam
"Crowd control, directing traffic...",2,20,Dwight
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe… you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.,8,23,Andy
Just go home. It doesn't matter.,8,7,Pam
Really?,4,10,Michael
"Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the ""Electric City"" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -",6,14,Erin
"I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.",9,10,Pam
"I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with. Just fun, healthy young woman.",4,10,Michael
That's really funny.,2,9,Ryan
"Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.",6,7,Erin
"Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.",7,21,Michael
"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?",8,24,Pam
"I'm coming back the wrong way.  It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?",5,7,Pam
He's going to absolutely freak.,5,12,Michael
"What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?",5,6,Dwight
You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  Do you know what this is for?,3,20,Michael
Ah. Well. That's not true.,3,9,Michael
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.,8,4,Oscar
"End the mistakes, easy-",8,6,Andy
"My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?",4,8,Jim
"I, I need something to wipe my hand.",5,17,Michael
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.,8,4,Andy
"There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's  hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.",3,4,Michael
"Ladies and gentleman,",7,16,Michael
"It’s just a list of our names, split into two columns.",8,1,Jim
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.,5,21,Ryan
"Here he comes, shhh...",1,6,Jim
"You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say ""Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is."" I can't wait.",7,10,Dwight
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.,5,6,Dwight
"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.",4,10,Michael
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?,3,10,Phyllis
We called Angela?,5,7,Andy
"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",2,10,Pam
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.,1,1,Michael
"Hey, can we just focus?",3,11,Michael
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So…,9,3,Dwight
I have to go Phyllis.,7,8,Erin
As I was saying it.,6,3,Michael
"Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.",6,4,Michael
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?,8,10,Kevin
"See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. See what I did?",5,6,Michael
"Dammit, Oscar!",4,13,Michael
That is so awesome man!,4,11,Ryan
"No, I think you're cutting in line.",3,5,Michael
"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.",2,15,Michael
Could you...?,2,1,Michael
Go get 'em.,7,1,Jim
"Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.",2,9,Jim
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?,3,23,Kevin
"Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",6,24,Michael
"A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.",3,8,Michael
"Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!",6,15,Erin
I did not do this.,7,1,Jim
"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.",7,11,Andy
Push. Good! That's great. You got it. Excuse me.,2,19,Michael
"All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent.",1,5,Michael
"Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.",9,20,Angela
Oh.,7,12,Jim
"Oh, man!",2,22,Dwight
If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.,7,17,Erin
You did. Yeah.,4,11,Ryan
"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",5,10,Jim
I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...,7,11,Michael
You missed a spot.,9,12,Darryl
"Ok, well then let's leave like right now.",9,6,Erin
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.,8,6,Erin
Good. Please hurry.,4,11,Jim
"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",1,1,Michael
"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!",3,11,Michael
So how you feeling about the new company?,5,20,Michael
"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.",8,11,Andy
"Michael, please.",3,9,Ryan
What do you like best about Pam?,2,13,Michael
"Gabe, I don't-",9,16,Erin
I... twisted it.,5,26,Phyllis
I forgive you for kissing me!,7,20,Oscar
"Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?",2,4,Dwight
Alright.,5,17,Jim
"That's OK, we're good.",8,3,Jim
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.,7,2,Dwight
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,2,22,Michael
"Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid.",8,3,Jim
"Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?",5,7,Oscar
All right. Are we good? You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,7,1,Michael
"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",2,8,Michael
... We're dating.,4,1,Pam
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?,5,25,Angela
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.,5,2,Michael
"Forward, definitely.",5,20,Jim
"Wow, this place is… so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.",9,11,Pam
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.,2,5,Michael
Because you're gay.,6,1,Kevin
"Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... You should fire the following people.",6,24,Dwight
But we were gonna break the pig rib.,9,9,Dwight
I said nothing fancy.,5,11,Angela
"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",3,4,Michael
Can I think about it?,4,12,Andy
"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",7,6,Pam
I don't know. Oh! That's... not... yours.,7,6,Jim
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.,6,21,Michael
"If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me.Voice #1 on phone Hey how'd it go?Voice #2 on phone Yeah, what'd she say?",4,3,Andy
"General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.",7,23,Dwight
She said yes! And the crowd goes wild! Woo!,4,14,Andy
"guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.",8,22,Andy
"Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.",6,15,Erin
"Yeah, right?",9,2,Andy
That seems a little far-fetched.,6,5,Andy
"It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.",6,5,Oscar
"""Why are you helping her? You're not even dating."" She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...",5,2,Michael
Will you stop?,2,12,Jim
"Robert, you are too kind.",8,12,Ryan
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.,8,14,Angela
"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.",7,17,Jim
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,8,13,Jim

Because you've solved zero cases.,5,23,Jim
It was me.,8,12,Kevin

Right!,4,1,Jim
"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.",7,2,Michael

But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?,9,22,Jim
"We’ll see. You are an assistant who’s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us.

I don't know what to say.,6,16,Erin
"Pull over, pull over!",4,6,Jim
"Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.",3,18,Darryl
"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.",8,18,Oscar
"Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.",7,13,Andy

"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.",6,9,Andy
"No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed.",6,9,Jim
"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...",6,3,Michael

"Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!",8,22,Andy
Ok great.,9,18,Jim
Insult.,2,17,Michael
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?,7,24,Kevin
"Oh! You’re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?",9,11,Dwight
"Yeah, do tell.",5,9,Dwight
"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. What-",5,9,Andy
You've gotta be kidding me.,7,1,Pam
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.,3,17,Michael
"Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.",7,19,Oscar
Just keep pushing...,5,3,Michael
"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...",6,3,Jim
"Oh, alright, yeah.",2,1,Michael
He wears glasses. Did you know that?,1,6,Michael
"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?",4,7,Jim
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.,3,21,Pam
"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.",5,11,Michael
"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'",7,18,Michael
"Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.",2,8,Jim

"Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",4,7,Michael
Did you even read the memo?,5,24,Dwight
In the ocean.,9,15,Dwight
"People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, ""Hello, how are you? How's business been going?"" And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?"" And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.",1,1,Dwight
"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.",2,3,Michael

"Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.",8,18,Kevin
"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",3,4,Michael
I think that I should help him get home.,4,2,Pam
"Take the call, friend.",4,8,Ryan

Anyone want to see the video from Cece’s recital?,9,12,Pam
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.,2,22,Pam
This is how business...,7,18,Dwight
We could do it in the warehouse.,2,15,Dwight
"Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. Bill Cosby.",5,22,Michael
Phillip is so fat.,8,13,Kevin
I'll give you five bucks for it.,6,6,Dwight
"Oh, boy. Um—",9,21,Pam
Fosters in the big can.,2,1,Dwight
"Oh, uhm, like three months.",7,8,Erin
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.,6,4,Kevin
This'll be the day that I died.,4,10,Michael
"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.",7,7,Pam
"It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.",9,4,Andy
Oh... at least we can kiss now.,8,20,Andy
"Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.",6,18,Angela
"Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.",7,17,Jim
I have been dreaming of this moment.,9,15,Andy
"Oh, that's funny.",4,2,Dwight

Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.,2,20,Dwight
"I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um...",5,13,Jim
"My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.",7,11,Michael
So? You started it!,9,14,Pam
Yes.,5,18,Michael
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.,8,16,Erin

"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?",6,16,Pam
"No, remind me.",5,14,Pam
Any luck?,8,19,Jim
"Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.",5,4,Michael
"That's OK, I don't want you to do that.",8,10,Erin
Okay. Thanks. Animal control will be here at six.,3,16,Jim
"Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.",9,20,Jim
"That’s true, yeah.",9,21,Jim
"Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.",2,1,Michael
Would you please stop that?,5,20,Jim
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,6,21,Pam
"The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.",6,16,Jim
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.,8,3,Pam
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.,8,3,Darryl
I had a tickle in my throat.,3,8,Dwight

"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.",9,1,Dwight
"Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it ""Hay Place"". Eldred Called it ""Hay World"". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it.",7,9,Dwight
"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.",7,24,Darryl
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.,8,14,Dwight

"Here, use my pen.",9,22,Oscar
I thought it was...,3,15,Phyllis
"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.",6,15,Dwight
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.,5,18,Kevin
"Okay, here’s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can’t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.",9,13,Dwight
And many more!,1,4,Michael
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.,5,1,Andy
"No, I can't... I ca...",2,17,Dwight
"So she looks at me right, and she goes, ""I'm sorry, don't I even know you?"" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?",3,10,Andy
"I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.",6,16,Dwight
What?,3,12,Michael
"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.",4,8,Michael
Look at that.,3,20,Jim
"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.",4,2,Andy
"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?",3,6,Michael
"Uh, yes you are.",3,17,Michael
"People are always coming to me. ""Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust."" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",2,13,Michael
Toward the sun.,5,22,Michael
"Good, what's funny?",3,8,Michael
"Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.",5,16,Dwight

"Angela, someone wants you.",9,22,Oscar
"Hey, let's call this what it is.",4,4,Darryl
"You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.",7,8,Dwight
C’mon.,8,1,Dwight
"No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?",5,14,Michael

"Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...",5,4,Dwight
"It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.",4,3,Dwight
"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.",7,7,Pam
Stop talking.,6,20,Michael
"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.",2,21,Angela
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?,7,15,Dwight
"Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you’re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.",9,8,Dwight
"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",2,20,Michael
"And I nevah got caught, neither.",3,9,Michael
You really think you can make it up to me with food?,7,1,Jim
What do we do? How do we stop this?,7,10,Phyllis

Okay. Well. Live strong.,2,19,Michael
Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.,6,7,Michael
I want to throw up just thinking about it.,6,20,Erin
Still not seeing the problem here.,7,17,Michael
"Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can’t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night…. I have to sing it.  We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.",8,2,Darryl
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.,7,17,Dwight
What in the name of God is going on?!,5,13,Phyllis
Menstrual cycles.,4,12,Dwight
Uh.,2,3,Michael
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.,4,13,Jim
Everybody got a government cow.,5,5,Darryl
"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!",3,6,Michael
"Oh, man, so many points being made.",7,1,Jim

Andy’s coming back today!,9,1,Erin
"Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I’m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let’s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?",9,12,Pam
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...,2,8,Pam
"Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? Uh, it's equal.",2,4,Michael
Are you scared?,6,8,Ryan

"Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",5,17,Michael
"You are clean. Okay… One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide I am going to generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing.",8,16,Dwight
"They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.",6,4,Michael
"No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job.",3,23,Dwight
You don't have all the facts.,7,1,Michael
"Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.",5,25,Andy
Store only has three employees.,5,12,Dwight
"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...",2,15,Michael
"Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?",3,20,Pam
"Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.",8,12,Kevin
Who cares? It's not that huge a sale.,6,21,Pam
I hadn't noticed.,4,3,Dwight
"Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. Well, you're an idiot.",2,2,Dwight
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?,8,11,Oscar
"Check this out though, spin serve. Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...",4,8,Jim
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,6,1,Jim
That's the original.,5,9,Oscar
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. ...Darn! Heh.,5,9,Andy
"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.",8,5,Pam
You can't have it.,7,9,Michael
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.,4,14,Michael
So she's really going to be fine?,4,1,Oscar
"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.",7,2,Pam
"Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.",8,20,Darryl
Hey.,6,15,Jim
I'm going to get it.,4,3,Michael
"Good, so, where are you going?",5,12,Dwight
"Really, that's your real name?",5,6,Dwight
Meat grinder.,8,11,Dwight
"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",8,13,Jim
"Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",5,3,Michael
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.,8,24,Andy
"Hey, how's things?",5,6,Jim
Please?,3,22,Dwight
Unh! Damn it!,4,14,Darryl
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---,3,10,Michael
"OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye.  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.",6,9,Michael
"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta “move on”. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.",9,16,Andy
Do I know what?,5,9,Michael
"Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we’ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War—",9,22,Dwight
"Well, I’ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.",9,19,Dwight
"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.",3,21,Michael
"Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...",5,13,Dwight
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.,5,22,Dwight
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--,7,9,Ryan
Hello.,2,11,Michael
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.,8,2,Erin
That was awful. Robert I apologize.,8,5,Andy
Sounded good.,3,4,Jim
Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,7,24,Jim
"Okay, good. Check that out.",2,21,Michael
"Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.",9,15,Andy
What?,5,17,Michael
So what kind of commissions you get up there?,3,2,Dwight
In costumes!,7,20,Pam
"My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you.",2,17,Michael
Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.,4,11,Michael
Maybe we should take a little break.,8,12,Dwight
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.,5,7,Jim
I'll check us in.,5,7,Oscar
Which one was it?,3,12,Jim
You know?,2,7,Michael
Am I the 107th caller?,2,14,Dwight
"Oh, I'll just time him later.",3,8,Pam
Testify.,7,5,Michael
"DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.De",7,20,Erin
"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...",2,11,Michael
Why'd you do that?,6,24,Jim
I lost it.,5,10,Angela
"Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.",3,4,Michael
"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",6,23,Michael
I'm going into labor!,8,8,Pam
You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.,6,6,Michael
You're trying to trick me.,6,3,Michael
How can you even be sure?,5,6,Jim
Oh yeah. Why?,3,14,Jim
I knew it. Is it waterproof?,1,6,Dwight
"Wait, what? Come on!",8,22,Jim
"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",3,12,Michael
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.,7,15,Kevin
"Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.",6,18,Phyllis
"Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?",6,19,Oscar
Stop forgetting things.,8,4,Dwight
"Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",2,22,Michael
It's like a time bomb...,7,15,Michael
I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.,2,12,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.",2,11,Dwight
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?,8,23,Jim
"Aggggh, that stings!",3,22,Dwight
"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your desk.",7,11,Michael
"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",4,5,Michael
"Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.",9,16,Pam
"See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?",9,18,Pam
"Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold. You know what else is best served cold? Yeah, gazpacho. You see what I'm doing? I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups. This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.",3,21,Andy
"As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!",5,15,Angela
"Ah, you are quite the gentleman.",5,5,Michael
"Catch you guys- Catch you guys on the filippity flip. Flippity flip! Flippity flip! Really? Okay, see ya guys!",7,21,Michael
That is a mistake.,6,7,Jim
"Well, you… you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.",9,23,Pam
"That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!",9,9,Jim
I went out to look for a better office space.,7,10,Pam
"Nope, he means tuna dog.",8,2,Jim
"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",2,3,Jim
"Old, mill, stream.",8,13,Darryl
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.,6,10,Dwight
"Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.",6,7,Andy
Call a client right now.,2,14,Michael
"Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.",7,16,Michael
"Tour, let's do the tour first.",4,9,Jim
"I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.",6,4,Dwight
How about a location?,2,22,Michael
"I know, I know, no, what... something else.",4,2,Michael
"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",6,16,Pam
You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies,2,1,Michael
"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",4,1,Jim
Uh... Ten year.,2,3,Michael
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?,5,3,Oscar
"But, umm, thanks for the break.",3,4,Pam
"Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.",2,12,Michael
"I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.",7,13,Andy
"Good evening, Dwight. What is this?",2,22,Angela
"Wait, it’s not D.M Utica, is it?Mr.",8,23,Dwight
I don't know. I'm just hungry.,7,7,Pam
"Well, for our profit...",6,6,Angela
"No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.",8,18,Kevin
"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",2,21,Dwight
It's mine. Don't worry.,9,14,Jim
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.,8,21,Phyllis
Not important.,3,11,Michael
I'd go with that.,8,3,Jim
"Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.Mr.",1,2,Michael
How much time do you think you'll need?,6,8,Michael
Okay.,6,6,Michael
"OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and everyone's just staring at her.",5,3,Jim
I guess.,9,21,Angela
"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.",6,16,Jim
"No, I'm good.",8,12,Andy
Good. Good.,1,1,Jim
"You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?",3,23,Michael
Could I have a copy of one of them?,2,17,Dwight
"No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.",7,19,Michael
Just a formality.,2,6,Dwight
Go move some paper!,9,14,Dwight
"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!",7,1,Pam
That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.,5,13,Michael
Uh huh. I'm not gonna call her.,4,11,Dwight
"Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... They are now off their meds.",9,5,Dwight
Just-in case. What's your last name?,4,13,Michael
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?,1,6,Dwight
"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",4,2,Michael
Where is my FREAKING phone?!,3,13,Andy
That movie is so scary!,3,5,Pam
"Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.",6,16,Michael
"Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.",3,20,Andy
"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",2,13,Michael
"""Jelp?"" J-e-l-p?",7,13,Pam
"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",2,21,Michael
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?,8,9,Andy
Why did that come into your brain?,6,1,Pam
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,6,15,Michael
I don't know if I can.,8,5,Jim
"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",2,11,Pam
No. No he's not.,8,22,Kevin
"Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, three points. The Question, whew, whew, six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.",1,5,Michael
"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by Aunt Shirley.",9,16,Dwight
I care if you like him.,7,8,Erin
"Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. Come on. Let's go in.",5,1,Michael
"Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?",8,3,Dwight
"Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better.",5,16,Michael
No. That is not a toy.,2,6,Dwight
Ready to do this?,5,12,Michael
If you say screw you one more time...,5,14,Dwight
"Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.",4,2,Dwight
"All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!",7,17,Jim
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?,7,18,Kevin
"Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.",5,4,Phyllis
Jim was supposed to collect it.,4,11,Phyllis
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.,7,24,Erin
"Make it happen, cap'in.",3,18,Darryl
"Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift.",3,19,Michael
"No, no, no, no! You don’t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There’s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don’t have diplomatic relations.",9,22,Dwight
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.,6,20,Kevin
Next question for our oldie-weds-,9,2,Oscar
"Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition.",3,20,Andy
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.,8,21,Andy
"I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.",1,1,Angela
"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.",6,17,Dwight
"Oh, thank you.",3,18,Michael
"Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.",5,1,Michael
Gaaaaa....,3,22,Dwight
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.,6,20,Oscar
"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.",2,11,Pam
Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?,5,23,Michael
"What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.",1,1,Michael
Yeah.,6,19,Michael
Mmm--- mmm... Um...,5,1,Michael
No one's even going to notice.,3,6,Michael
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.,1,2,Dwight
"That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.",6,6,Michael
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.,3,12,Jim
"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",2,21,Michael
"When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.",3,14,Pam
"Hi, Michael.",6,6,Pam
What's up-dog?,2,13,Dwight
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,2,15,Pam
"Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.",4,3,Michael
What the hell is going on?,6,12,Michael
"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",6,21,Michael
"Uh, yeah I do remember. Aw, they love each other.",6,15,Erin
"Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground.",4,6,Michael
Have you collected the money from everyone?,5,14,Dwight
"Ex-husband, you have to let it go.",2,8,Michael
"Yeah, you never know.",9,2,Jim
...So help us out.,4,10,Andy
Wait a minute.,3,22,Jim
Use your talons! Pry 'em open!,7,1,Dwight
"The company's probably going under, though.",6,10,Ryan
You bought me a house!,5,8,Pam
So pretty today.,8,4,Andy
Tank you Mr. Elwis.,6,11,Andy
"Andy, what are you doing?",7,22,Angela
"That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like",5,21,Andy
I have it covered.,3,4,Pam
"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.",9,13,Dwight
"Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.",6,4,Kevin
"Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",6,3,Michael
The aye's have it.,5,10,Michael
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.,9,14,Dwight
Ok. Thank you.,6,7,Michael
"Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?",9,18,Jim
You all right? You ok?,8,18,Jim
Anything else you need to talk about?,8,18,Dwight
I would have chosen the 1490's.,6,20,Erin
Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.,3,20,Jim
"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?",5,5,Jim
What are we doing at your parent's house?,5,8,Pam
It’s Okay.,9,5,Jim
"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the ""please""? We're not animals.",6,3,Jim
"Aww, my hero!",7,6,Pam
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...,8,9,Jim
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.,7,15,Dwight
Did you send him to the slammer?,8,13,Phyllis
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?,2,17,Ryan
"No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.",3,20,Andy
What do you want Dwight?,2,8,Michael
"What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.",5,4,Pam
"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...",6,18,Jim
"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, ""Mom, there's a ghost in my closet."" Now, you say one of two things - one, ""You're just having a bad dream,"" or two, ""Let's go see what it was.""",8,5,Jim
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.,6,7,Michael
Never.,7,15,Michael
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...,2,15,Michael
... What?,3,3,Michael
"Good night, D.",9,16,Angela
"How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?",6,11,Phyllis
"Oh, man, never thought I’d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.",9,23,Dwight
"No, not at all.",1,3,Jim
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.,5,7,Michael
"Great job everyone, that was fantastic.",3,22,Andy
"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.",5,5,Michael
"If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.",6,20,Andy
"On a wing and a prayer, mostly.",4,12,Jim
You gotta play along man.,7,20,Jim
"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.",3,8,Andy
"Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-",9,2,Jim
"Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.",2,13,Michael
"Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!",2,14,Dwight
Jim where is Pam?,7,21,Michael
"I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.",2,14,Dwight
"I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought ""Oh, she has a new bra with padding."" But then I thought ""Pam doesn't need padding."" It just didn't add up, Jim.",6,1,Kevin
"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.",3,8,Michael
"Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! Whoa! Aah, Aah!",5,14,Andy
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.,7,4,Andy
"Yep, that is a problem.",6,10,Ryan
"Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.",5,1,Michael
On the left.,3,11,Pam
I'm still Andy's girlfriend.,9,9,Erin
"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",6,3,Jim
So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...,4,10,Michael
"Yeah, yeah. The Shield.",5,24,Michael
Prank!,8,9,Jim
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.,7,14,Michael
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.,7,19,Michael
Are you going to kill me?,6,24,Michael
Cecelia.,7,19,Pam
So you're not doing it.,2,15,Jim
"Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!",4,1,Kevin
"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",4,7,Michael
What did I say?,2,8,Michael
"All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice.",5,24,Jim
"Oh, I know. We talked about it and he told me.",3,23,Pam
"We're here for the show, Michael.",6,8,Kevin
"Ah, I need my entourage Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.",3,10,Michael
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.,6,6,Kevin
We can save that.,7,11,Angela
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela Hmmm...,3,10,Kevin
"I mean, it's pretty broken already.",7,17,Andy
"Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.",2,2,Pam
"Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.",5,20,Michael
"Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.",3,10,Dwight
"Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. “Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.” That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.",9,22,Dwight
"Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.",2,1,Dwight
"Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.",4,6,Jim
"I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.",3,16,Michael
"Nice job on the cake, Bozo!",5,15,Dwight
"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.",4,3,Andy
Hey Goldenface.,7,16,Michael
Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?,9,9,Erin
"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---",4,7,Michael
John Dillinger.,6,18,Jim
OK. This is...,4,2,Ryan
I will see you at the inter-view.,3,23,Andy
"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",7,7,Jim
"It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.",6,16,Dwight
I'll see you later.,2,11,Michael
Some of us like the walk more than others.,4,10,Pam
"Hey, we'll be just fine.",8,13,Andy
This is smaller than your old place.,2,3,Dwight
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,6,10,Dwight
"Hey, Michael, where have you been?",6,19,Pam
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.,8,1,Oscar
Don't get on it.,6,1,Pam
"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",4,1,Michael
I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.,6,16,Pam
"I don't, I don't think we sh-",7,21,Pam
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. I don't think they're appropriate anymore.,5,10,Phyllis
You're in the gay mafia.,7,24,Pam
"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.",3,2,Jim
"Maybe I did. Maybe I called him, I don't know.",2,8,Michael
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.,8,8,Andy
Really?,1,3,Michael
"Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.",7,24,Kevin
How is that possible?,6,15,Michael
Still nothin'.,3,18,Jim
Confetti.,4,3,Angela
"No, you go -- okay.",9,12,Erin
I hope you find what you're looking for.,6,20,Erin
"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.",9,14,Pam
"Toby, can I really tell you anything?",7,2,Michael
"Aw, what the hell? Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?",5,25,Phyllis
A really awesome baby.,6,16,Jim
I can't believe this news. That--- wow.,3,3,Dwight
Sorry. Corporate policy.,4,14,Michael
Just close it.,7,18,Andy
"Really? Huh, that's cool.",5,2,Andy
"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.",1,5,Michael
I gotta get out of this dress.,9,23,Jim
I can't even talk about it.,7,8,Pam
"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it.",6,3,Michael
Chappelle's Show.,1,2,Ryan
"Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.",5,5,Michael
C'mon!,2,20,Jim
Yeah. Super pretty.,8,7,Jim
Okay.,6,21,Michael
It will be Angela.,4,7,Jim
You're welcome.,3,7,Michael
"No, no, I’m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn’t say goodbye to.",9,22,Darryl
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,6,15,Jim
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.,5,5,Dwight
Hey.,9,22,Jim
"Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.",3,23,Michael
Nice.,7,5,Kevin
"Oh, thank you.",5,9,Michael
"Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.",3,22,Pam
"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.",1,4,Michael
Hmm. Martin?,3,9,Kevin
I want to know.,5,7,Oscar
"Well, it wasn't an affair.",7,19,Pam
Who's this guy by our cars?,7,4,Angela
"No. Phyllis, you're not...",2,1,Dwight
I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.,1,2,Michael
"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.",5,24,Dwight
Yes. Homelessness. What?,6,19,Michael
"Thanks, Charles.",5,18,Jim
"No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.",5,22,Michael
Thank you.,9,15,Pam
"Fine! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",5,20,Pam
What the hell?,2,3,Dwight
"Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.",5,7,Michael
Are we both at the right place?,7,19,Michael
I will trade you for the used candle.,7,18,Dwight
This is plenty complicated.,7,2,Michael
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.,3,16,Pam
I think it went well. I think it was good.,5,26,Michael
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?,3,23,Michael
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.,4,1,Angela
"Comfortable, Mike?",3,18,Darryl
Gabe!,7,21,Erin
Take heed of.,5,13,Michael
"Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.",3,7,Michael
"“Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. “",9,23,Kevin
Walkie-talkies.,3,10,Dwight
Did you enjoy your lunch?,5,22,Dwight
"What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.",9,9,Dwight
"Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.",2,8,Dwight
Kelly don't do this.,3,14,Ryan
"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, ""Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,"" and then you have to be like, ""Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!"" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. Sex also works.",8,13,Andy
Don't even think about that,6,18,Michael
"Hey, don't touch him, please!",2,18,Michael
"Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?",4,14,Michael
That's not what that is.,5,1,Jim
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?,8,3,Andy
"November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!",8,5,Erin
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.,4,3,Michael
Woo hoo.,5,17,Michael
It's good to have you back.,3,8,Pam
The tea in Nepal is very hot.,9,22,Erin
We were... I think she was just trying to-,7,19,Jim

That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?,5,17,Pam
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.,7,9,Dwight
"We will wait for the call and you will smile. Let me try something, just while we're waiting.",1,4,Michael
Haulin' cube!,8,20,Dwight
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.,7,10,Pam
"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.",6,15,Michael
"Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.",7,21,Michael
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,2,19,Michael
"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?",7,2,Jim
"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.",6,4,Pam
"Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.",3,21,Kevin
"Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?",3,12,Jim
I can handle that.,1,3,Dwight
That’s what I’m talkin’ about.,9,8,Darryl
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?,2,2,Michael
"Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.",9,11,Erin
Humans are terrible for the environment.,6,10,Dwight
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!,5,26,Andy
It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.,4,4,Michael
"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",2,11,Michael
"What? Yeah, right. As if.",9,8,Jim
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.,5,7,Jim
"The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him ""Cool Guy Paul."" W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.",4,10,Kevin
Seventy-two hours.,8,24,Dwight
We're not.,5,5,Michael
"Michael, please don't.",6,1,Pam
You're the stupid one.,9,2,Dwight
"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",1,3,Dwight
"Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.Mr.",1,2,Michael
"You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.",9,21,Jim
"Hey, what up, Cynthia?",6,1,Michael
"That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",1,4,Dwight
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.,2,3,Jim
No this is Holly.,7,4,Michael
"Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.",6,19,Pam
"Thank you, Michael.",2,20,Dwight
That's cool.,4,14,Jim

"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.",2,1,Pam
Here we go. Everybody on.,5,1,Michael
Right there. The coach!,6,23,Michael
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,6,5,Dwight
I don't understand.,3,7,Michael
Ummmm...,2,9,Pam
"Okay, I’m a woman. I’m a woman. Good?",9,7,Dwight
Left.,8,1,Jim
"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.",6,21,Pam
"You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.",7,4,Andy
"No, I didn't. You know why?",5,1,Jim
Fine! Please make sure no one is humping me!,7,17,Andy
"Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!",7,20,Pam
"Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.",4,7,Michael
"Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...",3,19,Michael
Yeah. That would be perfect.,2,5,Michael
Look at that. Unh. Unh-unh.,5,9,Michael
You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...,3,14,Michael
"All right, um... sorry.",3,1,Michael
"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",2,21,Dwight
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.,8,6,Dwight
That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,4,2,Michael
"Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.",1,2,Ryan
Is it called Ghostbusters?,8,5,Pam
"You all made it, thank you so much.",7,3,Andy
"he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.",3,15,Michael
Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.,2,3,Jim
What is this? What happened here?,2,21,Dwight
Really? Where did you hear that?,3,7,Pam
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,1,3,Pam
So I closed the door but the image of his...,4,1,Pam
"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.",3,23,Michael
"Ang. Ela. Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--",5,1,Andy
But you did still love him.,7,12,Michael
No? Um... Check your spam folder.,2,2,Michael
"The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.",4,14,Dwight
Pam's sales are fine actually.,6,8,Jim
Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.,6,6,Michael
Ah.,3,2,Michael
She looks like a monster.,5,12,Kevin
"Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.",3,7,Dwight
"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.",7,2,Michael
Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.,4,1,Michael
"I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.",6,12,Andy
"Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas.",9,6,Andy
"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. Yes.",5,17,Michael
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...,5,11,Jim
OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?,5,3,Kevin
"She's not a virgin, you know.",5,2,Dwight
That was not a fail.,9,4,Andy
"No, that's not what I-",8,20,Jim
Whass...up!,1,1,Michael
Hey buddy.,5,21,Dwight
"And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.",7,13,Pam
Gabe!,9,16,Erin
"Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.",8,15,Dwight
"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.",6,24,Michael
"Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.",8,3,Kevin
Lay it on me.,3,21,Jim
"I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?",8,2,Jim
"Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.",7,8,Erin
Ener-gize...,4,12,Michael
They match the carpet,5,14,Dwight
"""Cage Match""? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.",2,21,Michael
Dammit.,8,8,Andy
I can help you with that.,4,1,Pam
"You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.",5,8,Ryan
Oh yeah?,4,3,Jim
I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.,3,3,Dwight
Really?,2,4,Michael
"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.",6,21,Dwight
"Sensei, you’re not watching.",9,21,Dwight
That Swayze sure can dance dirty.,9,7,Andy
Nice job everybody. Great work.,4,11,Jim
Okay.,4,3,Michael
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.,7,3,Dwight
"Toby? Mm hmm. I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...",2,5,Jim
She had a hysterectomy.,1,4,Dwight
"What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?",9,18,Kevin
"Yes, but they are both in danger.",2,17,Pam
Can I get a drink?,3,2,Jim
Ummm... I don't know.,3,17,Michael
Sixty thousand dollars a year.,5,20,Ryan
I don’t see it.,9,1,Dwight
"Yep. Cool, man.",2,15,Jim
"Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...",7,4,Michael
"Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",2,18,Michael
As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.,5,10,Michael
"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",6,15,Michael
"Okay, okay. Who could do music?",4,5,Michael
"Okay, I'm not doing every number.",7,9,Jim
"No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.",3,23,Phyllis
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?,6,3,Kevin
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.,9,16,Dwight
"No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.",3,12,Dwight
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!,6,20,Angela
Looks like they forgot the power cord.,3,10,Ryan
"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call…Dwight…",8,6,Andy
"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",2,8,Michael
But it's the season of mercy.,5,10,Angela
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?,6,20,Erin
The Washington University Public Health Fund.,7,9,Ryan
Maybe you've got mono.,3,6,Dwight
"Huh. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? .",3,17,Dwight
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,5,3,Michael
"Oh, there we go.",5,9,Michael
That is completely untrue.,8,13,Angela
"How ya feeling, better?",4,1,Dwight
"Yes. You alone do, actually.",7,9,Ryan
"So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?",2,8,Jim
"Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.",3,8,Michael
Ok... nice.,5,10,Phyllis
"There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?",2,14,Michael
About what?,6,19,Michael
You look really pretty.,5,9,Jim
"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.",4,14,Jim
I'm starting my own paper company.,5,19,Michael
"All right, guys. It didn’t work out for any of us, so… we’re still on the same team. Let me get these.",8,23,Jim
"Can you give me a second, sir.",2,1,Dwight
Hi.,4,2,Pam
Who's the target?,3,11,Dwight
"I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.",5,15,Oscar
"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?",4,1,Michael
Oh. That's nice.,3,3,Michael
"Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.",7,18,Pam
What were your favorite moments?,3,7,Dwight
Shut up. You're a freak!,2,1,Phyllis
That is a penguin. You like it?,3,8,Andy
"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",6,10,Jim
"Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.",7,4,Dwight
"Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?",2,3,Pam
Could be.,7,17,Dwight
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.,3,10,Dwight
I can handle that.,1,5,Dwight
"Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?",5,1,Michael
Then why'd you even offer!?,6,6,Pam
"I was in that marriage arena, though.",3,6,Michael
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,8,13,Dwight
Do you accept?,3,23,Dwight
"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",8,13,Dwight
"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-",8,20,Andy
"Same thing. Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.",9,6,Andy
I thought your name was Pudge?,3,19,Michael
Do you have any savings?,3,3,Kevin
"Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.",9,16,Angela
Nazi was a fascist movement...,2,18,Dwight
"Can you... You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?",7,24,Jim
I have to hear it from her.,6,22,Michael
Happy Valentine's Day. It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! Ahh!,2,16,Dwight
I will raise. Thanks.,2,22,Jim
It's right here in PA.,8,8,Erin
"Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. Ok... lower the mic for the midget.",5,13,Michael
"Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid.  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",5,10,Dwight
Yeahhh.,2,10,Kevin
"Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.",7,9,Jim
"Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.",5,22,Andy
"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.",6,23,Michael
Fumble! Yaaah!,2,17,Dwight
"Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.",7,12,Michael
I'm thirsty!,2,12,Dwight
"You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.",6,4,Andy
You speak English?,7,4,Dwight
Yeah. I can barely...,2,13,Dwight
Okay. And how do you feel?,6,3,Jim
In training.,6,14,Michael
"It's small, I know.",5,22,Dwight
"Si, senor.",9,16,Jim
I need to pee.,7,14,Michael
"Kevin, don't! Come on!",7,12,Pam
"Make way, nope, inspect me.",9,10,Dwight
"Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.",4,3,Andy
You were on a boat.,9,15,Dwight
"I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.",2,10,Ryan
"Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.",4,6,Jim
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.,5,8,Dwight
"Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead.",4,3,Angela
"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.",9,14,Jim
"Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.",6,7,Andy
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,7,17,Pam
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.,3,12,Andy
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,3,7,Pam
We have more houses to visit.,5,17,Dwight
Pam told me.,6,22,Michael
You gotta include me in the conversation.,5,5,Darryl
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?,7,24,Phyllis
"Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he’s been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.",9,23,Dwight
"It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.",3,23,Michael
Dwight. Hey.,8,13,Oscar
"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.",9,15,Andy
I just thought-,7,6,Kevin
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?,3,14,Ryan
How many is that?,6,19,Michael
Thanks Phyl.,9,23,Jim
"Okay, I guess, it’s just that Phillip got you something.",9,22,Oscar
Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?,9,12,Pam
"Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-",7,6,Kevin
"Pam, don't worry about it.",5,5,Jim
"No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.",7,19,Michael
How much? How many pounds is it?,5,8,Michael
"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.",7,4,Pam
"No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.",6,5,Kevin
"Yeah, we all really...",2,22,Jim
"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",4,5,Michael
"Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?",4,8,Jim
I will try.,5,7,Andy
OK.,3,6,Michael
"...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.",9,6,Dwight
I'm going to!,7,21,Kevin
Yes.,2,9,Michael
"Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.",2,5,Michael
"OK, what's up?",5,16,Dwight
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?,2,22,Darryl
All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!,8,17,Jim
Why do you need more gas?,7,18,Pam
"No, my all time favorite!",2,4,Pam
"Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?",1,4,Michael
What?,3,8,Michael
"No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?",3,20,Jim
"No, I do not.",8,23,Andy
It's gorgeous. Let's go!,3,19,Dwight
You follow him on Twitter?,7,1,Jim
"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",9,23,Dwight
"Hey, look at that. Done.",7,15,Andy
"Mm, can't do that.",4,5,Jim
"No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?",3,19,Dwight
"Well, he is.",3,1,Michael
A statue.,3,4,Michael
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.,4,12,Dwight
Jan's here.,2,22,Dwight
Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.,8,5,Erin
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,6,4,Jim
"No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.",1,5,Michael
"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.",8,3,Jim
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.,8,14,Dwight
"Okay, this is it. This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like ""Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person."" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",3,7,Michael
"""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon""",6,17,Andy
"Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again.",8,18,Kevin
"Okay! Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.",6,8,Michael
Hamster.,2,14,Michael
Well...,3,11,Michael
"Yes! And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.",6,8,Andy
Correct.,9,4,Darryl
"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.",4,2,Dwight
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.,2,7,Jim
"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.",7,18,Michael
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.,3,11,Phyllis
Everything seems pretty much under control.,2,13,Ryan
"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.",4,1,Michael
Michael! What's going on?,5,20,Pam
This is getting weird.,5,15,Kevin
"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.",9,16,Andy
You said come in!,4,1,Pam
Do you think she'd keep it quiet?,4,11,Michael
"Yep, here they are.",7,1,Oscar
She bought it? OK. OK.,3,11,Michael
Good luck with that.,8,9,Darryl
You gotta be kidding me.,9,10,Jim
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.,3,23,Kevin
Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? Whoo!,3,16,Michael
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?,7,1,Dwight
"Uh, yeah, the one...",1,1,Pam
Um... Oscar's kind of cute.,2,4,Pam
Oh! Hey. What is this about?,5,19,Michael
"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.",2,2,Darryl
Admit it. Admit it.,8,13,Dwight
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.,3,19,Darryl
"There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say ""Delivered."" Should I delete all of those?",6,11,Erin
"Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",9,14,Pam
"You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.",1,5,Michael
It's a miracle.,3,15,Dwight
In our neighborhood...,4,12,Phyllis
Outside of work.,5,11,Dwight
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,8,5,Pam
"Well something's come up, I have to go.",7,8,Dwight
You could out-sell Michael any day.,2,14,Angela
"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",8,10,Andy
"I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.",2,7,Angela
I love you.,7,1,Pam
It's close.,1,5,Dwight
What are you up to?,9,22,Pam
"Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.",5,26,Michael
"I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.",7,24,Ryan
Cheeseburger or hamburger.,8,4,Darryl
It's called being smart.,3,19,Pam
Yes.,5,3,Michael
Oh yeah.,4,3,Jim
"Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!",7,2,Oscar
"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.",7,17,Pam
"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",2,11,Michael
"Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, ""Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it."" And ""Border-line harassment when you call me at home."" But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.",2,16,Michael
You did uh... okay.,2,15,Michael
"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",2,22,Michael
Let's start with... your mom.,2,18,Jim
"Hello, may I help you?",5,16,Michael
Where are they?,6,18,Dwight
"Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.",9,6,Angela
OK. Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,9,14,Pam
Where?,3,21,Dwight
"You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...",9,10,Pam
I just said there isn't love.,9,15,Erin
"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",2,5,Michael
"He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.",2,1,Jim
‘Gy-na’ said that?,9,7,Dwight
"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?",5,3,Jim
"He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?",6,13,Dwight
I can make myself cry.,7,7,Andy
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.,5,14,Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.",6,8,Dwight
"So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. Dammit Kathy!",8,10,Dwight
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?,5,2,Michael
You're four seasons in a day. You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- Put if you put on a blue... It's Spring Time in the Rockies!,7,8,Andy
I got the stamps.,2,17,Ryan
"Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.",9,6,Dwight
"Well, we’re both just kinda learning as we go, aren’t we?",9,1,Dwight
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.,3,21,Michael
"Well, that...really bums me out.",7,5,Andy
And one for good measure!,8,3,Oscar
Bye everyone.,4,5,Phyllis
It's a lullaby.,4,11,Dwight
I'll see what I can find out.,7,8,Phyllis
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.,9,15,Oscar
You're welcome.,6,4,Michael
"Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town.",7,16,Michael
"Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...",7,5,Jim
"Yeah, you too.",2,6,Pam
"A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.",9,2,Erin
"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",1,2,Jim
How is that better than a barbecue?,8,4,Pam
"Hey, how is... Toby?",3,2,Jim
"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.",2,17,Dwight

"Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.",8,7,Kevin
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.,1,1,Dwight

"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",7,6,Pam

"Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.",9,9,Dwight

Oh?,2,9,Jim
Just run! Take the stairs!,8,23,Dwight
"Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.",5,6,Dwight
What are you writing?,5,17,Michael
"Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.",7,23,Jim
"I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.",5,1,Michael
"Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. Ah, okay.",5,20,Michael
Well guys with girlfriends don't.,5,17,Jim
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?,5,22,Michael

So sexy it becomes hostile.,5,16,Dwight
"Well, okay...",6,15,Michael
What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.,5,19,Andy
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.,7,1,Michael
All right.,6,22,Michael
"Angela, I'm sorry.",4,1,Pam
Get 'em there. Get 'em there.,5,24,Michael
Don't you want a sheath for that?,4,7,Dwight

"I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters.

..just have some messages for you.,9,16,Erin
Get out of Jim’s seat.,9,21,Dwight
"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought sorry. I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...",5,13,Michael
"Hey, is Katy coming?",2,9,Ryan
"Ready, one bullet. And boom!",6,23,Dwight

"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?",8,8,Andy
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.,5,18,Andy
"This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.",6,2,Darryl
"Oh, no, absolutely.",3,23,Jim
What do you race cars?A.J. I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.,5,15,Michael

"Quiet, you.",2,5,Dwight
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.,8,13,Phyllis
"Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.

Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.,9,14,Darryl
It's pony.,5,24,Dwight
There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.,5,23,Michael
"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.",5,20,Michael
Now that's going on?,7,8,Michael
"Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.",8,16,Pam
"Alright... Hey, did you change?",6,16,Jim

"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.",1,4,Dwight
"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?",3,11,Michael
That's a text.,7,10,Darryl
Can I use it?,5,22,Michael
"Hey, who's dirt box is this?",7,17,Dwight
Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.,2,12,Michael

"So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.",8,5,Angela
In you go.,7,13,Ryan
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that’s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.,9,19,Dwight

Evil! although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.,8,22,Andy

I like it so far.,8,14,Pam

"By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam?",4,11,Andy
"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team.

"Oh, I wouldn't-",5,4,Jim
"Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is? This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?",3,20,Andy

I'll help you!,9,16,Angela
"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?",8,13,Andy
"Uh, is that it?",1,2,Jim
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,8,13,Dwight

"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?",2,6,Michael
"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",2,16,Pam

Of course.,8,2,Pam
One for me one for Jan.,4,3,Michael
"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, ""I told you so."" Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.",5,2,Michael
Don't fire me. Please.,3,3,Dwight
Will do.  I'll stop calling.,4,11,Jim
"Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?",3,21,Jim
"No, I don’t… no.",9,11,Angela
This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.,6,10,Michael
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,6,15,Dwight

"Oh, yes, we do.",2,8,Dwight
"Not you, Erin.",7,14,Dwight
"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",2,2,Michael
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.,9,6,Erin

"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",2,21,Michael
"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",6,18,Jim
"I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.",8,3,Darryl
"I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other.",5,21,Ryan

Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.,7,24,Pam
"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",8,10,Andy
"I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.",2,16,Michael
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,3,7,Michael
"Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.",2,17,Angela
"At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was ""Hubble"" because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.",3,6,Andy
"No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!",2,1,Pam

Love you! God.,9,18,Angela
"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.",6,5,Oscar
So why did you come in here?,5,8,Jim
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,2,21,Pam
"Oh, yeah.",2,22,Jim
"There's a guy, there's a guy.",4,6,Michael
It means “excellent”. And we have begun.,9,3,Dwight
"I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.",2,18,Jim
I don't understand. Which one is that?,4,11,Phyllis
"Great. She's cute, huh?",1,2,Ryan
Yeah.,4,14,Michael
Oh...,2,12,Jim
"Okay, when you’re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?",9,7,Pam
"Oh thanks, Phyllis.",5,8,Jim
"I'm moving down here, you know.",8,16,Erin
"No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?",2,7,Michael
Big smiles folks! There they are.,7,20,Dwight
"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",6,9,Michael
I’m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where’s Stanley?,9,7,Dwight
You read the fax.,6,16,Erin
"'ello, mate!",3,20,Kevin
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!,6,23,Michael
"Oh, call me later!",9,10,Pam
Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.,6,4,Angela
"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",4,2,Jim
"Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?",2,3,Jim
Make a delivery.,4,3,Darryl
"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.",2,1,Michael
"Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",9,12,Pam
"You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.",5,19,Michael
I've got a treat for you!,7,21,Dwight
A dime and a nickel.,3,5,Ryan
Hmm.,8,7,Pam
"Yes. Well... we can... uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?",2,18,Michael
"Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?",2,4,Jim
"Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.",3,1,Dwight
We took a walk.,7,15,Pam
How about some Splenda?,3,17,Michael
What award would you like to give Dwight?,2,1,Jim
"Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.",3,18,Oscar
"Yeah, I noticed that.",6,23,Michael
"Okay, I’ll call you right back.",9,7,Jim
That's exactly what I was thinking.,2,13,Michael
"K, I’m gonna need some help. Pam?",8,1,Dwight
"If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.",2,19,Pam
"If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.",3,19,Andy
The boss isn't funny.,3,13,Dwight
Oh thank God.,6,5,Michael
"Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.",3,22,Jim
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.,7,18,Andy
What about you?,9,19,Dwight
Yes.,5,1,Michael
Now what?,4,3,Dwight
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,8,7,Dwight

Come on!!,3,12,Dwight
I don't understand.,3,7,Michael
"Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.",3,20,Jim
Big deal.,3,12,Jim

I said see you later building.,7,10,Kevin
"Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!",4,4,Michael
Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.,6,1,Michael
"I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.",3,18,Pam
Oh.,2,1,Jim
I need him gone.,5,23,Michael
"...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.",5,14,Dwight
Are you kidding me? Oh!,2,14,Michael
From my secret admirer. That's you!,7,15,Erin
"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.",1,1,Dwight
"Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?HCT Member #3 Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ.",9,5,Andy
"Neither am I, it’s already done. Hah, I’m just kidding, it’s going to take some time.",8,2,Andy
"Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful.",9,9,Darryl
"No, I was um...",3,5,Pam
Like a benign tumor.,7,15,Erin
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday.  But I dream... so...,5,19,Oscar
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,3,6,Michael
"You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?",8,20,Kevin
Eughh.,6,23,Dwight
"I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.",5,11,Angela
"Well, you are boner-ific.",6,22,Michael
"Mind if I close the door? What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.",7,17,Andy
"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.",6,18,Michael
All right.,3,18,Michael
I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.,2,17,Angela
"Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?",9,9,Jim
Stop it! It's gonna be great.,7,5,Jim
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?,3,17,Dwight
Correction. It was my idea.,6,11,Andy
"All right, I'll take them.",7,18,Dwight
You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. That is 100 percent your idea.,8,8,Ryan
You were let go.,4,2,Ryan
"You're doing great Michael, look at you go!",4,1,Oscar
"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.",6,21,Jim
Oh yeah?,1,3,Jim
Cut.,3,20,Dwight
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?,6,20,Erin

Nice.,7,5,Kevin
"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?",2,11,Dwight
"Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.",7,9,Jim
"Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.",9,16,Dwight
"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow. O'",6,10,Michael
"What I'm saying is that,",3,18,Michael
"I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.",7,21,Michael
"Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.",1,2,Michael
"You did good, Dwight. It’s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan’s not normal. Let’s just go. She’s not going to sell to us.",9,7,Pam
Do you want an M&M?,3,3,Michael
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!,7,11,Dwight
I don't get it.,8,8,Phyllis
"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.",7,1,Andy
I think she wasn't wearing a card.,1,2,Jim
"I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...",3,23,Michael
Ah-choo!,4,13,Dwight
"I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!",2,14,Michael

"And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.",7,13,Pam
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.,8,21,Ryan

"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No.  Would you excuse me? No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk Excuse me? Excuse me?!  I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!",2,7,Michael
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?,7,11,Erin
"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.",7,24,Andy
We're watching it.,2,9,Michael
"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.",6,2,Dwight
Sorry I tried to kiss y...,5,14,Andy

Covered it up.,8,13,Andy
"Oh, I’ll be the buyer.",9,7,Pam
"The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think.",6,11,Erin
This is your—you brought this on.,9,21,Andy
"Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.",7,2,Michael
"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",6,2,Jim
Yes.Erin and,8,19,Erin
"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.",3,3,Pam
"It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.",9,3,Darryl
They are unrelated.,2,17,Dwight
I don't care.,7,6,Jim
"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---",3,23,Michael

"Ok, tell him that's not true.",3,19,Dwight
I actually sleep better when it's raining.,8,21,Phyllis
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.,8,21,Andy

"I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.",6,1,Kevin
"You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad.",7,20,Pam

"Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?",3,14,Michael
"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",7,17,Dwight
"Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",6,3,Jim
"There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.",6,16,Michael
"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!",6,16,Michael
Grab you here.,7,15,Michael
Just ugly enough to have deniability.,8,7,Dwight
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?,9,4,Jim
"Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.",6,4,Michael
"Okay, here I come.  Pam's mom Oh darling! You look beautiful.",6,4,Pam
Thanks. Nice flowers.,8,14,Darryl
"Uh, wh-why would she say that?",4,8,Michael
Ding dong.,5,17,Jim
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!,2,14,Dwight
Wow. From janitor to manager?,8,24,Andy
"Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---",3,18,Michael
"It's John Gotti, you idiot!",6,5,Andy
"No, I meant you’re getting colder. The correct response is, “the coffee in Peru is much hotter.”",9,22,Erin
What bathhouse?,7,24,Oscar
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!,8,7,Andy
I am calm.,6,9,Andy
"Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?",6,14,Erin
"No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 230 to 315. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.",3,14,Michael
I’ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I’d be proud to take.,9,21,Jim
Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.,4,3,Dwight
Darryl?! Darryl!,9,22,Erin
It doesn't really seem like you.,7,11,Pam
"Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",8,6,Jim
"I don’t know what to tell you, man.",8,2,Jim
I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?,8,24,Andy
The human being man's name was Devon.,2,5,Michael
But I just—it’s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn’t…,9,21,Andy
That is my name.,9,4,Kevin
Thank you!,4,14,Pam
"And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Ah! OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say “get a drink”.",8,10,Erin
"Darryl, what do I do?",9,20,Andy
We're the cast of,7,3,Andy
Yes.,4,9,Michael
Like a month ago.,7,3,Andy
"You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.",3,2,Michael
"Hi, can I help you?",4,12,Pam
Were you?,2,14,Angela
"Ooh, someone's freakin'.",6,16,Michael
Ha!,8,8,Dwight
"Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?",3,22,Michael
"Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.",5,8,Ryan
"Ahh, I don't think so, no...",6,6,Ryan
Come -- come with me.,9,8,Dwight
"Andy! Nah, that's too far.",3,19,Jim
That's a good point.,6,21,Jim
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar.,8,18,Kevin
My Cornell a capella group.,9,5,Andy
I would drown myself.,2,2,Pam
"Um, sniper rifle?",3,3,Jim
Espresso?,1,6,Michael
No you didn't.,4,4,Dwight
Sure it is.,5,5,Michael
"Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.",5,11,Angela
"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",8,12,Dwight
"I mean the guy I used to be. I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too.",5,2,Ryan
"No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.",6,19,Dwight
They call me Kevin.,9,4,Kevin
"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?",3,11,Jim
"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",7,11,Michael
Sex.,1,6,Dwight
It's Phyllis!,2,3,Pam
"And, I'm freaking out.",3,5,Pam
"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.",6,5,Dwight
"Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!",9,6,Jim
Next stop pies!,9,4,Kevin
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.,4,4,Michael
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.,7,5,Ryan
Yes.,3,4,Michael
"Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.",8,15,Darryl
True love's kiss.,8,15,Jim
It's that easy?,7,12,Dwight
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.,8,11,Andy
I was trying to go-,8,18,Dwight
Not so much.,2,13,Michael
"What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!",7,12,Michael
"Would you just fire me, man?",8,3,Darryl
No it's not.,7,20,Michael
"No, no, no, means please don't. Please.",3,17,Michael
"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",9,12,Pam
I think about that all the time.,3,5,Ryan
Would bring me a flavored coffee.,8,3,Pam
"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",6,15,Jim
"Come on, be for real Mike.",3,18,Darryl
"Well, yeah, what can I say, a player’s gotta play.",9,8,Darryl
Oh.,8,17,Jim
Damn it.,8,12,Dwight
"Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?",6,12,Michael
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.,4,14,Angela
"Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?",9,4,Oscar
"January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.",7,12,Michael
"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.",4,8,Michael
Not enough though.,8,1,Pam
"Okay, we’re good. We’re good. Let’s go. Push!",9,19,Dwight
What's up? Nice to meet you.,1,1,Ryan
Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.,3,14,Michael
"Dwight, get out of here!",5,12,Phyllis
Hell yeah!,9,3,Darryl
Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,6,3,Michael
"Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who’s the strongest? Well, there’s only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.",8,23,Jim
"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",6,6,Jim
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.,3,17,Kevin
I don’t like him either.  And yet I really like him.,9,8,Dwight
He's not kidding.,7,5,Dwight
"Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, ""Don't Just Dream it, do it."" Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone.",7,13,Andy
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.,3,13,Oscar
I have really enjoyed our time together.,6,16,Erin
"Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.",3,11,Michael
Wait. Why?,7,13,Erin
No. What party?,5,6,Jim
Jim? Tell them what it's called.,8,3,Erin
"Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.",3,2,Michael
Traitor. You are a traitor.,3,7,Michael
What's up? I got your e-mail.,6,22,Andy
"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.",8,21,Dwight
You can't dock my pay-,8,21,Andy
Check this out! Look at that! Look at that bwup-bwa! Hello! How are... Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.,2,15,Michael
All right.,3,23,Michael
"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie.  And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.",2,7,Jim
"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",4,7,Michael
You know Darryl?,7,11,Andy
How much time do I have?,4,7,Jim
"Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.",9,19,Dwight
"Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!",7,8,Kevin
"Is Ryan gonna fire me? I don't know. I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago? Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard. And it's not even a good beard.",4,14,Jim
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.,6,12,Kevin
"""I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.""",4,8,Michael
He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.,7,24,Erin
"Mmm, yeah.",4,13,Michael
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.,6,4,Dwight
"Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?",8,12,Kevin
"The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day.",5,19,Andy
It feels unbelievable!,7,4,Kevin
They're so not.,4,1,Pam
"Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!",3,9,Michael
It's from both of us.,3,17,Dwight
"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?",3,7,Michael
"I, uh, hmm.",4,13,Michael
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.,6,22,Michael
Croak!,7,5,Kevin
Try harder then. Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.,3,10,Angela
"Yeah, that's pretty good.",8,3,Jim
Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?,2,8,Dwight
What do you-!,9,16,Erin
Oops.,9,10,Angela
"Hey, where’s my ring?",9,11,Phyllis
"Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.",8,3,Angela
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.,5,22,Dwight
"I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, “What's your stance on politics?” Or, “What is the best war to do?” And, I will just be like, “Duhhhh!”",9,3,Erin
Ahhh!,4,7,Oscar
"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",5,10,Michael
Why not?,1,1,Jim
It’s okay. The hell does he know?,9,19,Andy
That's a real thing.,1,3,Kevin
"Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.",5,6,Dwight
"Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.",4,7,Angela
The twirl sucks.,6,10,Dwight
"I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.",7,2,Dwight
"Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?",7,20,Dwight
Darryl. Noble Darryl.,3,7,Michael
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.,6,21,Erin
"You know, I don't care what he did to me. He's mean to other people, that's what gets me. He's just...",4,12,Michael
I'll tell you later.,3,7,Phyllis
"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.",7,2,Michael
And have a good elevator ride.,6,21,Michael
I stole Nellie’s phone.,8,23,Pam
"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",4,4,Michael
What else you got?,6,4,Erin
How are you?,3,2,Jim
We lost the account.,5,14,Andy
Boi-oi-oi-ing,6,23,Kevin
"Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor? Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages? That'd be great.",4,14,Jim
What's going on in here?,6,8,Dwight
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.",7,11,Pam
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!,8,22,Jim
No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.,6,8,Pam
"Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.",5,19,Michael
"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.",1,1,Michael
Call him!,9,18,Angela
Stay alive! I'm getting help!,5,13,Oscar
"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",6,22,Michael
"Let's go, let's go.",8,10,Andy
Fire girl. Too soon?,5,10,Kevin
Say that? Uncanny.,9,22,Dwight
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.,6,9,Michael
Alright. How would you like to celebrate?,6,16,Angela
"David, wait.",5,8,Michael
Sometimes it hurts Michael.,3,8,Dwight
"It's nothing, I'm robbing her.",4,1,Dwight
Fantastic.,7,22,Jim
"Oh, hey no biggie. Just...",4,8,Michael
"20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.",2,14,Phyllis
"Hey, thanks.",6,20,Pam
"You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.  What is taking that guy so long?",7,13,Michael
"Oh yeah, did he text us?",7,22,Jim
"Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.",5,20,Pam
I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.,5,16,Dwight
"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?",6,18,Jim
Why are you doing this to Andy?,5,5,Angela
"OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.",5,13,Jim
I did not order a stripper.,3,14,Michael
Her name?,9,7,Dwight
"Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.",8,21,Phyllis
I'm trying. Sorry.,9,4,Erin
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.,3,5,Jim
So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.,6,8,Michael
"""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."" ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."" Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.""",2,21,Michael
Well I think we're past that now.,6,12,Michael
"Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .",7,18,Andy
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.,7,18,Kevin
It's for your trouble.,5,22,Michael
I changed it. To Chili's.,2,7,Michael
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!,6,5,Dwight
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?Camera,9,23,Dwight
"Okay, now here’s the plan. I’m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.",9,19,Dwight
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.,8,16,Darryl
Is this Robert’s attempt to embarrass me?,8,23,Andy
Inspiration.,5,17,Dwight
"Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",2,20,Michael
"Oh, I still have more.",5,14,Michael
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.,1,2,Michael
In a minute. In a minute.,8,12,Andy
"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.",7,15,Michael
"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?Pizza guy What kind of business is this?",4,3,Michael
Still no one calling.,1,3,Pam
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.,7,4,Dwight
"Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!",8,11,Oscar
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.,6,7,Michael
We will be well-rested tomorrow.,6,23,Pam
Alright. Why don't you just-,8,24,Jim
"Good, we're all here, we can get started.",4,2,Michael
"It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",2,13,Jim
Ooooohhh no!,2,9,Pam
"My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.",7,1,Darryl
Stop!,7,11,Jim
"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?",8,1,Andy
Say no more.,8,1,Dwight
"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",1,3,Michael
Haaank. Is that you?,4,11,Jim
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.,3,10,Michael
What?! Really?,9,3,Darryl
In-grown hair.,7,18,Michael
I have a conflict with that.,2,7,Michael
Yeah.,4,3,Michael
Uh huh...,7,8,Michael
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper.,9,20,Andy
"Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.",9,5,Darryl
"No thanks, guys.",3,7,Pam
"It is the ""Whitest Sneakers"" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!",2,1,Michael
"Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.",8,9,Oscar
What are you doing?,1,1,Jim
"No, three-month-old humans don't do that.",8,16,Pam
"Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday.  He has no idea!",2,9,Dwight
"Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.",5,4,Dwight
Great. Let me just...,1,1,Jim
Like... a year.,6,4,Pam
300 and one penny.,5,4,Dwight
Dar de dar.,2,7,Michael
It's totally impossible!,5,20,Michael
"Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.",7,10,Oscar
"That seems early, even for her.",4,1,Kevin
"No, not right now.",7,13,Michael
Get up.,8,18,Jim
We'll bill you.,4,2,Dwight
Well I have interviews.De,7,21,Michael
Can I go back to my desk now?,9,22,Angela
"Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.",7,7,Michael
"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.",7,17,Dwight
"Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.",5,18,Michael
"Ooh, it’s when you get a free sandwich after you’ve already eaten ten sandwiches.",9,12,Kevin
"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--",5,16,Michael
"Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer.",3,10,Darryl
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.,9,4,Dwight
"And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.",5,22,Dwight
Ready! Go!,3,22,Michael
Pick up.,2,6,Michael
"No, don't. Don't do that.",1,4,Ryan
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,8,6,Dwight
"That’s the winter season., three months.",9,7,Kevin
Sixty - forty. Hm?  I'll drive.,5,1,Dwight
"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you’re ever in the area, you’ll always have a place to stay…in my barn.",9,23,Dwight
"Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.Darryl's sister Hey, hey, hey!",7,19,Darryl
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.,7,6,Kevin
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?,3,19,Ryan
"Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.",5,1,Andy
"OK, I am really going to do this.",3,21,Michael
"Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye.",5,12,Dwight
Ok. She's ok?,7,14,Pam
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.,5,24,Ryan
"Yes. In my top three, so suck it.",2,4,Pam
So much for sex without consequences.,5,4,Michael
"I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.",9,11,Dwight
Can I get a list of your vendors?,4,14,Phyllis
"Yes, I...",3,23,Michael
"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today. Should we get him an ice-cream cake? Mint chocolate chip?",4,7,Pam
"Yeah, but you have to calm...",6,22,Pam
"No, no, no. Blah blah blah blah!",6,19,Dwight
"Pam, are you my friend?",4,7,Michael
"Shh, shh.",9,14,Pam
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?,2,17,Jim
"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...",6,23,Michael
Yeah?,2,21,Michael
Because we're friends.,2,6,Dwight
"Ok, give that back to me.",2,6,Dwight
"Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?",2,6,Jim
Did you see that?,2,2,Kevin
You have to change the channel to PBS.,9,22,Erin
"Well, he’s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.",9,22,Oscar
"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",2,11,Michael
"Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.",2,2,Pam
"Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.",4,2,Michael
"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",6,3,Michael
"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.",3,11,Michael
"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?",7,18,Dwight
Above and beyond.,5,18,Michael
What up?,9,22,Darryl
"Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.",5,5,Michael
Is your password Frodo?,1,4,Jim
I’m going in there.,8,1,Andy
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.,9,14,Dwight
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?,7,6,Andy
Nice to have Oscar back.,3,13,Michael

Hey! Gabe.,7,12,Erin
"Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space?

"Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.",7,6,Kevin
"Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.",9,8,Phyllis
"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.",2,14,Michael
You hit her?,8,24,Pam
"Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.",6,16,Jim

"Hi, Michael.",7,9,Pam
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,6,20,Jim
"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don’t think anything’s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there’s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",9,1,Pam

"Hey, stranger!",8,18,Pam
"Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, ""What are you gonna do, breakup with me?"" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.",9,10,Darryl

"Billy, your nurse is hot.",2,22,Michael

"Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?",2,12,Michael
"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?",3,11,Michael

Don’t!,8,9,Dwight
"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I’m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.",8,7,Jim
Why don't you just get rid of this guy?,5,12,Dwight
"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.",3,11,Pam
"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?",7,10,Jim

Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.,6,16,Kevin
"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.

"I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.",7,12,Kevin

Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.,8,24,Jim
Nope. I did not see you either.,9,17,Kevin
"That'd be great, thank you.",8,10,Jim
"Cleaning people. Oscar. OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.",4,11,Jim
"I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't .",2,10,Kevin
"Oh, it is warm.",8,12,Angela
"No, no, no, no...",7,5,Jim
"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",9,13,Dwight
"Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.",5,18,Michael
"I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.",3,11,Dwight
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.,5,26,Michael
Pretty sneaky sis.,7,17,Andy
I say we have a parade.,5,1,Darryl
"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",3,1,Michael
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?,2,3,Michael

OK what?,8,3,Andy
Do you think they canceled the wedding?,6,4,Erin
I know.,2,18,Pam
"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.",2,8,Dwight
"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.",8,7,Jim
"He defecated, aw.",8,24,Dwight
"Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!",9,18,Oscar
"Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that’s the guy that Erin’s flirting with?",9,12,Kevin
"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.",2,6,Michael
"No, thirty.",4,10,Kevin
"That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.",9,20,Darryl
You're not going to get my permission on this.,2,20,Angela
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,9,15,Pam
"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",6,3,Dwight
"Well, shall we make it a little interesting?",7,18,Darryl
"It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.",7,21,Phyllis
"Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.",6,10,Ryan
"Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone.",8,11,Ryan
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!,2,17,Michael
Really?,3,3,Michael
"Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee. Do you want some coffee er-Sadiq (IT guy) No.",2,9,Michael
"Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!",8,21,Andy
"Um... unless you really, really want it back.",3,8,Ryan
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.,2,19,Michael
Beep! Bop!,2,9,Michael
"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...",2,19,Jim
"No, you lost those clients.",5,24,Michael
"Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",6,22,Dwight
I could go for an appeteaser.,3,17,Michael
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.,7,14,Jim
Sounds good. Fudge it up!,7,21,Michael
Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,6,6,Dwight
"I can’t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.",9,13,Dwight
You know what?,6,10,Jim
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,7,2,Dwight
Oh! Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.,9,18,Angela
Oh... is it...,4,2,Pam
And Dwight.,2,13,Dwight
"Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.",8,13,Kevin
"Oh, Thank God. We are famished!",9,23,Dwight
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.,5,25,Michael

Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...,6,6,Angela
"What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.",5,5,Andy
"Oh, really? From what, two to four?",6,11,Andy
You said you weren’t going to look back.,8,8,Dwight
"You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?",5,19,Oscar
Okay.,6,8,Michael
"Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.",9,6,Oscar
"If you’re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea  that you can’t please everybody all the time.",9,8,Pam
Should I get water or donuts?,2,22,Dwight
We have an extra outfit in the bag.,7,7,Pam
"It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here.",6,11,Dwight
That's what she said.,5,5,Michael
Super important.,9,21,Pam
"Would you, please? Please.",3,20,Oscar
"Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.",6,12,Dwight
"Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.",5,13,Michael
100 dollars.,5,4,Oscar
What are you going to see?,8,4,Andy
"Happy birth moment, Michael.",2,19,Dwight
No no no no no no!,5,13,Michael
"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",6,15,Dwight
"Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...",9,18,Pam
"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",7,11,Michael
"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.",2,5,Michael
What a cute bench.,4,9,Pam
"Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.",2,13,Michael
"So, when, um, can I see you again?",5,4,Michael
You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.,2,14,Michael
"No, you know what? You do it.",2,16,Dwight
"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",2,21,Pam
Irrigation.,4,4,Pam
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.,3,13,Phyllis
Emergency dentist appointment.,3,20,Dwight
"Thanks again, Charles.",5,18,Angela
Why is the truck empty?,8,3,Andy
"So, you will?",7,5,Michael
"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.",4,4,Michael
"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don’t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So… have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let’s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So…yes. I’d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.",9,23,Dwight
I might go to the mall.,1,3,Pam
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?,7,4,Michael
"I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.",2,22,Kevin
"Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.",7,23,Kevin
"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",5,9,Michael
That's ridiculous.,3,1,Michael
To waiting.,6,4,Jim
"Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.",6,6,Pam
"Toby Flenderson, come on up here.",4,14,Michael
Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?,5,3,Andy
"Hello, I would like to apply for a job.",5,12,Dwight
"Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.",9,21,Andy
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.,7,21,Pam
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.,2,20,Michael
"No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.",6,6,Michael
"Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.",3,18,Jim
Hmm.,9,19,Pam
She's dead? She's so young.,4,10,Michael
Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.,2,8,Dwight
. Is everything okay?,9,3,Pam
"Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that’s what working at a paper company’s all about!",9,12,Dwight
Oh really?,4,14,Michael
"Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. ""Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.""",2,22,Michael
"No, no, no, ""Tracks of My Tears"" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?",8,22,Pam
Or chairs?,5,9,Pam
Hey.,4,2,Jim
But why not find out.,7,24,Erin
Yep.,5,2,Jim
"Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It’s all garbage okay? You’re the woman, I’m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.",9,7,Phyllis
Well I have an idea.,8,2,Erin
"Hey, how's it going?",2,22,Jim
It's unbelievable!,2,17,Phyllis
"What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.",5,13,Andy
But it says no late fee... .,2,4,Oscar
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?,1,5,Michael
"OK, Kenny.",9,2,Jim
"Good trip down?AJ Yeah, it was great.",7,11,Michael
"Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?",9,16,Erin
So beautiful. Hey--,6,4,Jim
"Okay, stop watching me.",6,16,Pam
"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.",3,11,Michael
Dad?,2,12,Dwight
"You're typing ""Big Boobs""?",7,9,Pam
Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If?,8,23,Angela
You coming down?,1,5,Jim
"We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?",7,4,Darryl
"Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.",4,11,Jim
Yes you do.,2,6,Michael
"Angela, you still have your son.",9,21,Oscar
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.",2,6,Dwight
"No, I'm just testing if he can hear.",7,15,Andy
"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?",5,15,Jim
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.,5,1,Dwight
That's true.,5,18,Michael
Thank you weirdo. Pam's mom everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.,6,4,Pam
"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.",6,18,Dwight
"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?",1,2,Jim
"So, you ever been convicted of a felony?",3,2,Dwight
"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",4,9,Jim
"You work on commission, don't you?",7,2,Dwight
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow’s his wedding day. You can’t be anything but happy on your wedding day.,9,23,Jim
"Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.",9,6,Andy
You don't have email on your phone.,3,2,Dwight
"Dwight, look, I’m sorry you’re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.",9,12,Darryl
"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.",5,10,Michael
Right over by that fence.,6,16,Dwight
"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",6,9,Pam
Pam?,3,5,Jim
I'm right.,4,13,Michael
"Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.",4,11,Michael
What... What's that? Whatcha doing?,2,14,Darryl
I don't know about that.,1,4,Michael
"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.",2,9,Michael
"With vodka, you're the best.",4,11,Ryan
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.,5,21,Michael
"Hoop it up, right.",6,19,Oscar
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.,7,15,Michael
Bye.,7,14,Pam
"Uh, no thanks, I'm good.",3,4,Ryan
"Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla.  She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.",7,22,Pam
"Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.",7,14,Jim
Hey. You're looking for me?,7,15,Ryan
"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. What are you doing?",6,10,Michael
Excuse me?,6,4,Andy
"Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!",9,10,Jim
Oh my God. Huge!,3,23,Pam
Oh... kay...,2,21,Michael
"Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it.",2,9,Michael
Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.,5,8,Michael
"It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.",8,11,Oscar
No we’re not.,8,7,Phyllis
"Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?",5,15,Dwight
"Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother’s, and I’ll meet you at Poor Richard’s in an hour.",9,22,Oscar
"Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?",3,11,Andy
I'm right in your crack!,3,8,Michael
Which one's this? Perfect.,4,3,Jim
"I mean, he’s gotten worse over the years….",8,2,Angela
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...,3,8,Michael
"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?",5,5,Michael
"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",2,19,Michael
"I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.",6,6,Erin
They do call me that.,7,1,Pam
"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",7,16,Michael
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.,5,7,Andy
Let's not go crazy.,7,17,Andy
"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",7,24,Jim
Not what I asked.,8,12,Dwight
I need a soup spoon.,5,11,Dwight
"Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.",6,1,Michael
A baby what? A human?!,9,4,Andy
"Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah.",7,22,Andy
"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.",2,6,Michael
"Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.",3,12,Michael
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,6,22,Pam
Yeah. I’m afraid he’s only gonna have hot dogs.,9,2,Pam
Aaaaaaaa!,5,3,Dwight
"The waving? Ad guy 1 Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.",4,5,Michael
Did my scores drop a little?,5,6,Jim
"That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.",3,4,Michael
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.,7,6,Kevin
"Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.",7,11,Phyllis
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,6,2,Michael
"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",2,13,Jim
"That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?",5,3,Angela
"I'm talking about Angela, okay? Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?",4,4,Andy
"Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!",4,6,Michael
"No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people ""faggie"" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.",3,1,Michael
User error. I’ve heard of that happening to other people.,9,12,Oscar
Romances?,2,8,Kevin

P.S. We should should kill him.,8,6,Dwight

"Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.",4,11,Michael
Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.,5,11,Michael
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...,2,17,Jim

Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?,8,8,Phyllis
"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together.

"Well, there is no inner...circle.",7,22,Jim
"I want it to be like... ""Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?"" ""Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous."" ""Well, guess what, that was Michael Scott."" ""But it was anonymous, how do you know?"" ""Because I'm him.""",1,4,Michael
She's... high-maintenance.,3,9,Jim
"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.",9,16,Dwight
Michael.,6,8,Pam
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",4,5,Pam
"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.",9,15,Andy
"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder.",6,1,Andy
How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?,4,4,Michael
"Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.",3,13,Andy
We're friends.,2,3,Pam
Of the hourglass..,9,4,Andy
Ok. Bye.,2,12,Pam
"Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.",2,14,Dwight
"I’ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.",8,2,Andy
Dunh-duh-na-dah!,7,9,Kevin
You guys! Yes! Yes!,4,2,Michael
"Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?",2,18,Jim
"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.",7,23,Jim
"I'm right here! Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.",8,12,Kevin
"Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.",3,16,Michael
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,7,24,Jim
Whatever.,3,17,Michael
"I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...",2,17,Phyllis
"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",7,11,Michael
"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.",6,15,Jim
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.,9,20,Angela
"Oh, Andy.",9,21,Pam
"No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?",5,2,Kevin
"Actually, you did.",3,19,Darryl
You are not going to believe this.,1,4,Jim
"Jim, move!",3,11,Dwight
What?,2,12,Michael
I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--,5,24,Michael
"Anyway, um... I miss you.",5,3,Pam
"Look at that one though, he's smiling!",8,22,Jim
"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, ""apology accepted"", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.",5,24,Michael
"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.",9,2,Dwight
"Oh, you know what? I gotta go.",9,9,Jim
Are you serious?,6,9,Jim
"Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?",4,3,Angela
"Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.",2,18,Michael
You didn't see it?,2,8,Pam
"Okay, great-",7,5,Jim
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.,3,5,Ryan
Don't you dare tank this.,9,20,Angela
"Well, No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?",8,14,Dwight
"Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.",7,10,Dwight
"Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.",2,3,Jim
"Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.",2,16,Michael
"No, not exactly.",5,18,Jim
I think I blew it. It all happened so fast.  So... fast.,5,16,Kevin
"Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.",2,7,Dwight
Jackpot.,3,9,Andy
About what?,6,21,Michael
"Oh no, that's, that's not happening.",7,11,Kevin
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.,5,4,Dwight
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.,8,13,Oscar
"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",7,11,Michael
Wow.,2,5,Jim
"Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.",9,10,Phyllis
"Thanks, Michael.",5,24,Pam
"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",3,4,Michael
"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.",1,5,Dwight
"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.",8,11,Andy
A baby.,6,16,Pam
"It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.",6,12,Michael
Did I miss anything?,2,9,Pam
And replay.,9,12,Darryl
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?,7,11,Andy
"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...",5,9,Michael
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?,3,12,Angela
"Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh...Too much strudel.",9,9,Dwight
I could see enjoying that.,6,19,Angela
"Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?",5,2,Michael
"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..",2,10,Jim
Why wouldn't she?,7,12,Phyllis
You should try it sometime.,1,3,Pam
"Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.",5,22,Andy
"Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?",7,22,Jim
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,2,22,Pam
"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",6,2,Michael
Not with your hands.,4,9,Pam
"No, I've seen the video.",2,2,Michael
"This... is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.",6,1,Jim
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.,5,11,Dwight
"Well, I don't have a lot of choices.",3,12,Dwight
"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.",6,21,Jim
You ready for me?,3,18,Darryl
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?,6,17,Jim
"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",4,3,Jim
"Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?",2,17,Pam
"Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.",6,16,Pam
And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.,5,1,Andy
Ahh! OK!,9,16,Dwight
"Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ’95. Hey there, um, I’m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here…De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale…uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I’m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.",8,2,Andy
"Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.",7,12,Kevin
"Well, maybe you should get back to work.",5,20,Jim
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?,8,10,Dwight
"No, hey it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.",1,4,Michael
This is great. Oh.,2,5,Oscar
"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",2,2,Michael
"Okay, you need to focus, Michael. You need to stop spending money.",4,4,Oscar
I do not think that is funny.,2,20,Jim
"Stop! Stop! Stop! Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.",2,18,Michael
"I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.",5,19,Jim
"No, what happened with Donna?",6,22,Michael
"Smasher? No, where’d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city’s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.",9,21,Dwight
Okay.,4,3,Michael
"Thanks, it's cool. So...",6,19,Darryl
"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. Okay... okay.",5,15,Michael
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.,2,15,Michael
"Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.",8,19,Andy
"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",6,23,Andy
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?,3,2,Dwight
This way to the partay bus.,3,22,Michael
"Hi, nice to meet you.",4,13,Pam
Only one that I was kind of worried about.,7,18,Michael
"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.",4,5,Michael
"Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...",3,21,Michael
"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.",7,11,Pam
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...,1,3,Ryan
"This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.",5,14,Michael
"Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!",4,5,Michael
"You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?",7,9,Angela
Okay.,4,12,Michael
"Oh, he's out there.",8,20,Andy
I'm punishing them.,3,23,Andy
Why don't you like him?,7,8,Erin
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.,8,20,Andy
"Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?",2,9,Michael
"Goodnight, Michael.",1,6,Jim
Why would we take the dog?,8,3,Oscar
"Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.",3,13,Kevin
"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace. Follow me! Let's get this movin'.",4,5,Michael
"If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.",5,5,Andy
What?De,7,20,Michael
"Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.",7,9,Ryan
Why are you here?,2,22,Michael
"It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",2,12,Jim
"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, ""I wanna go to Mount Pocono,"" you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",6,22,Michael
"Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.",7,10,Michael
"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",7,17,Pam
"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I’m not looking south, I’m not livin’. That’s what I always say.",9,13,Jim
"Michael, that is hilarious.",5,9,Jim
"All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. ""I'm gonna get you, downsizing."" No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.",1,1,Michael
"Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...",7,3,Jim
"Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.",5,5,Angela
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.,5,25,Kevin
"It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",2,18,Michael
It's out in the hall.,5,13,Kevin
May I please speak to your boss?,9,7,Dwight
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?,6,19,Michael
Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.,4,11,Michael
"WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.",7,9,Ryan
"With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.",7,7,Kevin
Probably is.,2,21,Jim
"Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.",2,11,Jim
"Yeah, people hate you.",9,23,Kevin
Whoa. What are those stains?,3,2,Michael
"Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.",2,4,Dwight
"Yes, yes. He's sleeping.",8,13,Angela
"I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.",8,4,Dwight
That's crazy.,5,21,Erin
"You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.",1,5,Michael
"Yes, there’s Andy! Andy is in. I’m a good receptionist, I know he’s in.",9,21,Erin
"Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.",9,22,Dwight
"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",3,8,Michael
Because I'm gay?,3,13,Oscar
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,2,15,Pam
"And when you fell in, did you flounder?",6,7,Phyllis
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,3,8,Dwight
What do you guys think?,6,3,Michael
"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.",4,1,Dwight
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!,8,9,Dwight
"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.",8,11,Andy
"Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?",3,16,Michael
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,7,6,Michael
I'm gonna save you!,2,12,Dwight
Hmhmm.,8,22,Darryl
I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.,5,14,Michael
"Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.",9,16,Pam
You haven't buried her yet?,4,2,Dwight
That’s so great!,9,11,Jim
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.,3,11,Pam
"Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. Jim and",2,18,Michael
It's my back.,5,25,Phyllis
"Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.",3,20,Jim
"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.O'",6,10,Michael
"Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.",5,23,Michael
"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",6,10,Jim
"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",6,15,Michael
"Hey, you came in second. Not bad either.",7,16,Oscar
Could I talk to you for a second?,2,5,Michael
"No, we're good. Thank you, though.",7,3,Jim
"Should have done this a long time ago. Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters. Uh, uh huh. Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton? Poor Richard's number seven? Idiot. Stupid load.  Yeah.",2,9,Michael
"No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.",1,4,Jim
"You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.",4,1,Dwight
"Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food. You know how they say ""stuff a cold""? Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.",2,12,Michael
"Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",5,4,Phyllis
"All right, fine. Brrring.",5,6,Dwight
Oh my God.,3,5,Pam
"The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.",7,20,Oscar
"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",6,3,Michael
"No? okay, fine.",2,20,Michael
"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",7,17,Jim
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.,8,12,Andy
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?,6,6,Michael
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.,2,15,Dwight
"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",6,23,Michael
"Oh, you wanna go today?",4,7,Michael
"Oh, cool. Hey Clark.",9,13,Pam
In. I'm hungry.,8,6,Dwight

"Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.",2,6,Michael
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.,5,5,Michael
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?,9,5,Dwight
That's what she said.,6,18,Michael
"Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they’re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it’s a little much? …Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that’s what it feels like.",8,23,Andy
I bet. You guys.,7,7,Erin
"Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.",3,19,Ryan
Do we have to?,3,23,Kevin
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,7,17,Michael
"Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. ""Outside Hire.""",3,22,Michael
Alright. Here we go.,5,25,Michael
"And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car. There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor  What?",4,4,Michael
"Did a good job, Buddy. Now it’s time to come home.",8,19,Pam
She was from Europe.,6,4,Michael
"Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!",7,20,Angela
Did you plan it?,4,2,Phyllis
I said that!,5,18,Dwight
"You're right, it's better than you! It's us! Dunder Mifflin.Andy, Creed, Kevin,",4,5,Darryl
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.,8,16,Jim
"Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.",6,16,Michael
Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!,4,2,Michael
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.,6,24,Michael
"Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer.",5,10,Phyllis
I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?,9,16,Angela
Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,6,22,Dwight
I can try. I’m gonna use SMS text.,9,8,Dwight
"Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  Which doesn't exist.",7,22,Kevin
She would have definitely slept with me.,2,2,Michael
"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",2,13,Jim
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?,4,14,Jim
That is full of soup.,5,16,Michael
"No, I won't even consider it.",7,9,Michael
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.,3,2,Michael
"That doesn't mean anything. Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?",8,18,Darryl
Oh! That was really. This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.,1,6,Jim
"Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.",9,4,Jim
"Umm, hmmm.",2,13,Michael
"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",1,3,Dwight
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.,6,4,Andy
Are you a cocktail waitress?,4,4,Jim
Ohh... man.,4,2,Ryan
Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.,6,14,Michael
Poor hornet.,7,4,Dwight
"Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.",5,1,Angela
"If this job is in a well, I don't want it.",3,22,Jim
Right. Which one is that?,9,23,Dwight
I just saw this baby daddy-,5,3,Michael
"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",7,2,Michael
Yes. Come on. Totally.,9,15,Andy
You want to hear something sad?,5,23,Pam
"Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.",9,22,Angela
"Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I’m telling you... if you don’t do this, I don’t stand a chance. Please, Jim.",8,17,Dwight
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,6,21,Pam
"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",2,1,Jim
"Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.",4,4,Michael
"Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.",8,1,Darryl
You have to interview me...,7,24,Dwight
"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",7,10,Michael
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?,6,19,Angela
"Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",4,5,Jim
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.,5,22,Dwight
"Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.",5,14,Michael
You did do it?,4,7,Jim
"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",2,12,Michael
And it's clear we're not going to carry them.,8,3,Dwight
"No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.",2,9,Michael
Run what?,6,22,Michael
"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.",7,24,Dwight
Did it!,7,15,Jim
"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?",3,10,Michael
"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.",3,6,Jim
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.,8,5,Oscar
"Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.",5,5,Dwight
"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear ""Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la."" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",4,10,Michael
"Hey, it just takes one!",5,16,Dwight
"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.",3,10,Dwight
Do you even have a mattress?,9,23,Angela
Birthday.,5,15,Jim
"Wait, what? You can't take what?",5,11,Dwight
"No, this is romantic.",7,18,Michael
"Dwight, come on. Don’t end on a bad note.",9,23,Jim
Oh no. Fabulous.,6,5,Dwight
"Angela’s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it’s Angela who’s living in the closet. Hey-o.",9,22,Oscar
"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.",2,16,Oscar
It's like a ten minute walk.,4,10,Andy
Classy.,5,1,Dwight
"I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.",3,7,Ryan
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.,5,12,Dwight
I know.,2,12,Pam
Uck... T.M.I.,5,10,Michael
I do not.,6,9,Pam
I want an interview.,7,24,Dwight
Do that. Do it.,7,7,Michael
But we invited guests.,3,10,Phyllis
"Well we all want a good party, right?",4,14,Jim
It's too late.,5,11,Michael
"Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?",2,9,Michael
"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.",4,12,Dwight
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?,8,15,Dwight
"That was us, right there.",5,24,Michael
Five to six hours?,8,14,Andy
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!,2,13,Michael
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-,8,9,Andy
"No, orange is whorish.",3,10,Angela
"No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.",5,23,Dwight
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night?,8,11,Oscar
"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",4,2,Dwight
"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.",2,20,Dwight
Whoa. Whoa. Wait.,7,22,Jim
"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",2,22,Michael
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.,7,19,Oscar
So... here's the thing about infidelity.,6,23,Andy
Hello? Christian?,2,7,Michael
"Profound man, your husband.",8,1,Ryan
How many bottles? Three hundred?,8,12,Oscar
We have to come from a position of strength.,5,23,Pam
"Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.",2,14,Angela
I think it's a fun idea.,5,4,Phyllis
She does not like him.,6,21,Jim
What's his name?,5,13,Darryl
"Is everything ok, Michael?",3,17,Kevin
She's not doing it to hurt you.,5,15,Pam
Y'all.,6,9,Kevin
"Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.",3,21,Michael
That and that are the same letter.,6,1,Michael
What's going on?,4,3,Jim
Mr. Peanut is not classy.,5,18,Dwight
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,7,6,Jim
"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, ""I don't respect you!"" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. Respect is niiice. Borat. What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!",4,12,Michael
"Wait, why do you have to record it?",7,8,Erin
It's fish.,3,15,Phyllis
"OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.",9,15,Kevin
"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.",9,2,Jim
"Toby, Katy.",1,6,Michael
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.,9,4,Oscar
"Rolando, I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.",5,14,Michael
Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.,3,14,Dwight
So what was rule two?,2,4,Michael
Because he just loves me too much.,9,3,Pam
For your feet!,7,11,Kevin
Well... well damn-it.,6,4,Kevin
We'll use code names.,4,5,Andy
“Loyalty pledge”?,9,12,Oscar

Dude.,8,7,Darryl
Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!,7,21,Andy
"No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.",7,9,Ryan
"Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?",7,11,Michael
You're not talking... triple digits?,8,18,Darryl
"""Walk until you hear the beehive.""",5,9,Andy
"Wow, this is my lucky day.",5,6,Jim
"I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?",3,10,Jim
What do you mean “they left”?,8,3,Darryl
"Whatever, yeah.",5,23,Michael
"I want you to know. Kelly, look at me!  I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug.  Mmmmmm.",5,1,Michael
Shut up.,5,10,Angela
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.,9,5,Andy
Really did He responded L-O-L.,8,14,Jim
"Some people need dozens of friends to say, ""Hey, look at me, I'm popular."" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",3,2,Michael
Good. They good?,7,24,Dwight
"Michael, it's freezing out.",3,9,Pam
My lips are sealed. My lips are sealed... Bangles.,2,13,Michael
"Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.",7,3,Darryl
"What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?",7,7,Michael
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.,6,14,Michael
"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!",3,11,Jim
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.,8,9,Jim
Hey... Why did you do it?,4,1,Dwight
What would you have done? Been manager?,3,2,Dwight
"Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo.",4,2,Pam
"Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.",2,21,Phyllis
Stop that! Stop that!,4,2,Ryan
"Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?",3,15,Michael
"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.",5,17,Michael
"Be respectful, Dwight.",5,6,Michael
"Oh, we got this!",8,11,Andy
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.,4,8,Michael
"Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!",6,3,Angela

Do you want to die? OUT!!,2,4,Dwight
Had 'em all my life.,9,4,Dwight
"Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now",3,10,Angela
"Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.",3,15,Michael
"I just didn't, you know, want a deal.",5,2,Jim
"Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. “Scranton Mimeograph Corp?” I don’t think we’re doing business with them any time soon. That’s odd.  A letter from Robert Dunder. “A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.” The Holy Grail.",9,12,Dwight
"I'm creative, Ryan.",4,5,Michael
"I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?",8,1,Dwight
That’s funny. Ok.,8,5,Jim
"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",7,2,Michael
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!,3,8,Michael
Why would you do that?,4,14,Phyllis
"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.",4,7,Michael
"Okay, hey, hey, hey...",7,11,Dwight
I'm not-- I'm not following you.,5,23,Dwight
"Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.",7,8,Dwight
This came out really well. There you go.,2,21,Jim
Dwight! At least aim it.,8,3,Jim
Sorry?,3,11,Pam
"Andy, sing us another song.",7,3,Darryl
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?,2,1,Michael
Okay. You owe me.,6,8,Dwight
He does?,2,4,Jim
"I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.",1,6,Pam
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?,5,9,Dwight
Uh totally.,4,2,Pam
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,6,5,Dwight
"Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.",1,6,Michael
"It's not... Whether or not, you...",6,15,Andy
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.,6,21,Michael
"Okay, fireable offenses include workplace violence and sexual harassment.",5,8,Dwight
Twice.,2,12,Ryan
"Yeah, even cooler.",8,7,Andy
"Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.",4,1,Dwight
"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!",5,5,Dwight
"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.",6,16,Andy
"Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.’ I think she’s right. I feel calm now. I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I’m doing the right thing.",9,21,Andy
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.,2,10,Angela
"No, that was mandatory.",2,13,Ryan
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?,5,15,Michael
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?,6,20,Erin
I'm really sorry.,4,14,Michael
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.,8,13,Andy
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.,3,12,Pam
Oh no you ain't!,9,4,Pam
Ryan Howard everybody. Good job.,4,2,Michael
"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out.",4,7,Dwight
Hey!,2,15,Jim
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?,9,18,Angela
"No, you're supposed to say, ""Rock the house.""",5,21,Michael
"He's not my hire, but I know who he is.",9,14,Darryl
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.,4,12,Phyllis
Why does Erin like Gabe?,7,8,Andy
"I know.  Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.",7,22,Jim
Okay.,6,5,Michael
Who is this? How did you get this number?,2,14,Michael
Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?,7,4,Michael
I hope there will be management parables.,3,22,Dwight
Who else is he mean to?,4,12,Jim
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,2,6,Dwight
You are doing it.,7,20,Michael
"One, two, three, go!",3,11,Andy
All right. Mmhmm. Hey.,5,26,Michael
"You had a rough night tonight. But your life is very good, my friend. You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...",4,11,Michael
"We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.",3,16,Michael
"Oh, your face! Oh!",5,24,Michael
Just don’t do the song anymore.,9,5,Andy
"Well, if there’s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I—",9,3,Oscar
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.,2,1,Michael
"All right, this is just messed up.",6,24,Darryl
Parkour!,6,1,Andy
How old is she?,1,4,Oscar
"I don’t think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus.",8,8,Phyllis
And it's all inclusive.,3,10,Michael
"Hey, there! Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.",4,13,Michael
"They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?",3,8,Michael
"Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  ""Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days. Nashua branch."" Can I send them a dead deer?",5,1,Dwight
"Are you serious? Ugh. Where? Where? Where, Dwight?",5,11,Oscar
"Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.",4,6,Michael
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.,8,19,Dwight
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!,2,19,Michael
She's the one.,7,18,Oscar
What?,3,16,Michael
"Yeah, it's a golf text.",8,14,Jim
"Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.",6,16,Pam
"Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--",9,8,Jim
"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.",8,21,Jim
You dream in cartoons? How fun!,3,2,Pam
"With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.",3,20,Michael
He is an organ donor.,5,13,Michael
"Hey, Robert. We have that 930am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.",8,1,Andy

Close them.,5,19,Michael
Thank you.,5,23,Pam
I'm betting on myself.,7,9,Ryan
"Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.",3,18,Michael
You’re gonna po’ mouth,9,3,Darryl
"I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility.",4,6,Pam
"Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.",6,22,Darryl
Right. Okay.,7,15,Andy
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.",7,14,Pam
"Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.",4,13,Jim
"No, you are.",5,5,Michael
"Uuf, well...",2,20,Michael
Michael...,6,21,Pam
I have to pick one of those?,4,12,Andy
"It's just, like, so creepy.",3,21,Pam
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.,8,18,Andy
"Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.",5,18,Michael
"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",8,7,Jim
"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",6,5,Michael
Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.,8,7,Andy
"I've got an idea why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",2,6,Michael
I think you got this. Kay? Alright. Feel better!,7,20,Jim
"Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can’t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.",9,7,Dwight

"Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan.",4,3,Pam
Ok. Of course.,3,5,Ryan
You're the best. Thank you.,7,22,Ryan
"Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?",9,9,Dwight
"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",6,5,Michael
You got a minute?,8,23,Andy
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.,8,2,Erin
"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",5,13,Pam
Hey Toby! You suck! De,7,20,Michael
Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.Guy in audience 160.,5,4,Michael

"Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.",3,12,Michael
"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.",7,7,Pam
Mm-hm.,3,23,Jim
It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!,6,9,Pam
I wish my car had a bathroom.,9,9,Kevin
"So suck it.  Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.",5,16,Michael
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?,4,8,Jim
"What is up with you two, Holly?",5,26,Michael
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.,4,6,Dwight
“Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!” That means you can't make me do squat.,9,4,Dwight
"Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.",5,4,Michael
"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",2,3,Michael
"Oh, I bet you ask?",4,1,Kevin
"Please, not at a time like this.",4,10,Michael
Who did?,7,3,Erin
"I'm sorry, what was the question?",3,23,Pam
"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.",4,1,Michael
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.,4,3,Dwight
"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. ""You need to do something about your coffee breath""-",2,8,Michael
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.,7,9,Michael
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.,7,18,Dwight
"Can we talk about this later, I have to go.",7,21,Erin
"I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.",3,20,Michael
"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us!  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",7,1,Dwight
What?,7,19,Michael
"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",2,4,Michael
Words will never be enough.,5,24,Dwight
I did. Yes.,6,1,Oscar
"Hey, are we doing this thing?",4,13,Darryl
Cancel it! Are you still here?,7,8,Michael
"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.",3,8,Michael
Isn't it?,6,23,Michael
It costs seventy five dollars.,3,10,Pam
He didn't say.,3,12,Michael
That would have been really embarrassing.,3,17,Dwight
"Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.",7,19,Michael
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.,2,17,Michael
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,8,7,Pam
Things? People?,9,9,Darryl
"Mmm, mm mm mm.",6,12,Michael
"Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.",9,14,Angela
"Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.",4,8,Michael
"I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?",4,3,Dwight
"She is pregnant. She is knocked up. ""K"" Karen. Pam, let's go.",5,14,Michael
"There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, ""There's no place like home."" And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? It's gonna drive me crazy.",2,15,Dwight
Hi.,1,6,Pam
"No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.",9,2,Andy
"Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.",9,4,Kevin
Word. There we go. Let's see it.,3,22,Michael
Great. Get the plate number.,9,14,Dwight
"Hey, of course.",9,9,Jim
Yep.,8,6,Jim
"Good morning, Michael.",5,17,Pam
"Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.",2,1,Dwight
"Hey David, how would you like a guy who’s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",9,8,Jim
"Okay, be my guest.",4,13,Michael
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.,9,20,Andy
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.,8,24,Andy
You can do that?,5,9,Pam
Cause you’re interested in going into sales?,9,1,Dwight
Okay. You've just lost my business.,7,14,Michael
Actually here for something else.,5,23,Jim
"Oh, hey, man. Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.",9,9,Jim
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,6,14,Michael
I'm good. How you doing?,5,4,Jim

"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...",5,11,Jim
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?,9,7,Pam

"Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.",2,17,Jim
Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.,2,14,Jim

"We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.",4,4,Pam
"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.",6,24,Andy
Mmhmm.,4,2,Michael
He's already paying for himself.,5,20,Michael
Can't stay there all day.,7,23,Pam

Yours doesn't.,5,12,Dwight
Oh my God.Jim  This close.,5,12,Angela
"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?",6,8,Pam
"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.",6,11,Jim
"Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.",7,24,Angela
"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",2,6,Michael
We haven't set a date.,1,3,Pam
"Come on, Bob. Raise your hand.",5,16,Phyllis
"Well, well, well, it’s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.",9,8,Dwight
"Oh, here we go!",7,6,Michael
"Ok, I have an announcement.",4,1,Michael
It's junk!,8,10,Andy
"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.",5,22,Andy

Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.,6,7,Jim
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.,6,6,Pam
"Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.",7,4,Michael
"There’s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it’s not -- it doesn’t sound cool. You just have to see it.",8,19,Pam
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?,4,2,Andy
"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, ""Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."" So, maybe that'll stop now.",3,7,Pam
"Oh no, that would be great.",3,10,Jim
"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",4,10,Michael
Charles is going to tell you.,5,18,Michael

"You did this, didn't you?",1,3,Dwight
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.,9,1,Andy
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?,9,6,Angela
What? Kevin!,7,7,Angela
"I have some, uh, experience. I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.",4,8,Michael
Threatening you? No.,6,15,Ryan
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,6,4,Dwight
"Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.",7,11,Phyllis
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.,9,5,Kevin
"Got it, bimbo.",8,13,Erin
"Well, ah, ah...",9,15,Andy
Okay. Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.,5,10,Phyllis
"Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.",3,11,Michael
"Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?",3,12,Ryan
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.,7,24,Phyllis

"Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.",6,16,Andy
"Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!",7,16,Michael
Per diem.,3,2,Michael
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,2,22,Jim
"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",2,6,Michael
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.,6,22,Erin
"Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?",7,7,Kevin
"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",5,12,Dwight
You wanted to see me?,1,4,Dwight
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.,6,19,Michael
Roy said the first one didn't count.,2,11,Michael
"I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I’m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I’m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they’re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them. Someone should write a song about that.",9,23,Andy
"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.",3,10,Jim
I'm in.,2,10,Oscar
"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",8,10,Dwight
"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.",2,19,Michael
Make a donation.,9,5,Andy

Sorry!,5,20,Pam
"Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.",4,14,Dwight
"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.",8,6,Andy
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.,2,12,Ryan
"This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.",8,6,Dwight
"Maybe, I don't know.",2,11,Michael
Who the heck was that?,7,7,Pam
Have a seat.,4,2,Michael
"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on.",5,9,Pam
"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",4,3,Michael
"So this is like, um, an organization station... Pam's",2,2,Pam
"Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!",9,9,Dwight

That's pretty cool.,3,21,Jim
"Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...",5,11,Michael
I care!,4,3,Angela
"No, you will be tested.",2,20,Dwight
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.,8,9,Andy
Hallowed ground.,8,8,Dwight
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,4,6,Pam
"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.",9,23,Andy
"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",5,10,Jim
Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?,2,14,Michael
No. Why not do it now?,9,13,Dwight
"Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.",9,12,Jim
"Hey, whoa, Michael...",2,12,Jim
"Gentlemen, a word. Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.",4,4,Andy
"This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.",3,15,Michael
"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.",2,3,Dwight
How's that gonna help you?,5,13,Jim
How about that one?,2,15,Pam
IHop.,4,14,Michael
"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.",9,14,Pam
It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.,7,11,Ryan

"Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.",6,13,Andy
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.,9,6,Dwight
"Oh, neat.",8,10,Ryan
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.,8,9,Oscar
"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...",4,14,Michael
"You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.",6,15,Erin
"Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.",6,16,Michael
"Oh coffee, that's too much.",5,12,Michael
"All right, all right, shh!",7,12,Michael
Put cold tea bags on your eyes.,4,3,Pam
"I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.",6,8,Pam
"Yes, yes I do. I love that song. First I was afraid, I was petrified.",5,13,Michael
"Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.",5,6,Jim
"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..",2,10,Pam
Perfect.,6,16,Jim
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.,7,18,Michael
Sure. What's going on?,7,23,Andy
"Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.",5,22,Michael
Did you go to first base?,2,8,Jim
"My gift is forthcoming, Pam.",4,14,Michael
Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.,5,13,Michael
Don't do the twirl.,6,10,Pam
"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.",8,14,Dwight
Fine. I will give you one minute.,9,4,Andy
Hey man.,5,4,Jim
He envies you.,9,22,Jim
Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,6,1,Michael
It didn't have anything to do with race.,1,2,Pam
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?,7,20,Kevin
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. You don't have a plan.,9,2,Dwight
Just forget it. Just the urine.,2,20,Michael
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.,6,20,Kevin
One for you.,8,8,Andy
"Cool, let's start with the banisters.",3,17,Dwight
Michael it's not... It's not...,3,16,Ryan
"Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.",2,12,Pam
"Please, after the turtle?",9,1,Angela
He needs me. Seat saved infinity.,6,9,Dwight
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.,9,16,Andy
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?,3,14,Pam
"Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.",4,1,Dwight
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?,5,11,Andy
What the hell is a terrarium?,2,3,Michael
"Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?",6,24,Dwight
"Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.",2,14,Michael
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,2,21,Michael
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...,7,4,Dwight
This guy does it all.,2,2,Michael
You are busy! We're in a meeting!,7,5,Oscar
They're still good for another week.,7,17,Dwight
"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",7,11,Michael
Are you drunk?,5,7,Angela
Do you?,3,20,Jim
You don't even know what I'm talking about.,2,9,Phyllis
What? Was I not supposed to say it? What? Turn it back on.,6,12,Michael
"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.",6,21,Dwight
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.,1,2,Pam
It's cheaper.,2,11,Michael
"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",1,2,Michael
"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",4,7,Jim
Bull...  Sorry.,3,8,Dwight
And he's really into penguins or something?,2,9,Ryan
I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds...,3,18,Jim
"Ok, alright I gotta go.",7,4,Michael
Good luck.,5,6,Pam
"Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.",7,10,Dwight
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.,7,12,Michael
"Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him. And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",4,12,Jim
Uh-huh.,4,2,Michael
Yeah.,3,8,Michael
"Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I’m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.",9,12,Darryl
"It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.",3,6,Michael
However it's normally done.,8,3,Kevin
"Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?",7,12,Michael
"I'm messing with you, Holly.",5,1,Oscar
"Oh, well, I'm already married. Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.",4,12,Phyllis
"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?",4,1,Dwight
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.,6,12,Michael
Xterra's not even a real word.,3,8,Dwight
"Look, would ya... look.",2,15,Darryl
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.,7,7,Dwight
Electricity.,5,13,Michael
I have good cards.,2,22,Pam
I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.,7,16,Michael
MmMm.,9,16,Pam
Hey!Pam's,2,2,Pam
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.,5,22,Michael
"It was pretty uneventful, actually.",8,13,Jim
You have no idea what you're talking about.,6,23,Michael
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,2,6,Dwight
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.,9,4,Kevin
"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?",5,23,Jim
Why would you say that?,8,9,Andy
"Okay. Alright, bye Cece.",7,3,Erin
Oh I know.,6,19,Erin
I know. That’s great. It just - it makes it look like there’s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.,9,7,Erin
Bow down before Recyclops.,6,10,Dwight
"Pam, I’m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I’m not going over this again. Co-worker Jim. We need you.",9,12,Jim
We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.,9,9,Jim
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.,6,9,Andy
"Okay, good.",6,16,Erin
"No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?",7,5,Michael
"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.",7,18,Michael
"Probably, yes.",6,2,Ryan
"Ah, just the stupid leads.",6,18,Michael
You sure?,3,23,Jim
It means like this.,6,5,Dwight
"Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.",9,2,Pam
"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?",7,11,Erin
"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.",1,6,Jim
We got you this.,4,9,Pam
Did you get the yams?,2,12,Michael

Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.,5,25,Kevin
Hey.,4,14,Jim
"Um, Pam.",7,21,Michael
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!,2,6,Michael
"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!",6,3,Dwight
Not a viable option.,5,13,Dwight
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.,8,24,Angela
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.,8,15,Dwight

"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I’ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I’ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I’m doin’ great.",8,1,Dwight
"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.",8,13,Andy
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?,3,20,Angela
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.,3,22,Michael
"You are my producer, you are a suit. I am the creative genius. You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",4,5,Michael
Can you believe who Trump fired?,2,8,Pam
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?,7,21,Michael

"What are you doing? No. No, no, no.",8,18,Jim
"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.",3,1,Jim
I've only had to use it once.,2,20,Dwight
"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",2,15,Michael
"So, where are you shipping your foot?",2,12,Jim
Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?,6,4,Michael
Hawkman.,3,12,Michael
Of course you are.,9,17,Dwight
"I’m doing this just for me? Is that what I’m doing? I’m doing it just for me. If that’s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",9,12,Jim
"I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.",5,21,Jim
"Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today.",3,20,Pam
"Yeah, it is, Andy.",8,11,Angela
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.,8,16,Dwight

"No, I don’t have AIDS. That’s not what I said. Next question.",9,5,Andy
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.,9,22,Jim
What?,6,24,Michael
"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",6,20,Andy
"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.",2,3,Dwight
I think you've had enough.,2,11,Angela
It sure looked good on the mannequin.,5,24,Phyllis
"No, Dwight. The Senator.",9,16,Angela
"Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?",5,16,Oscar
He says Thank you.,9,5,Dwight
"If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?",5,1,Michael
"Yup, coming. All right.",8,16,Jim
"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...",5,9,Pam
"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.",8,14,Andy
"Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?",4,12,Ryan
"Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.",2,16,Dwight
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,2,11,Jim
"Not Michael, E.T.",7,12,Michael
Can't you do something about this?,8,19,Jim
Yeah. Yes!,2,17,Dwight
"No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side. Gym instructor No, guys, no. We're just cooling down...",6,22,Dwight
Really?,2,8,Michael
They did this up in Albany...,2,15,Michael
There he is!,9,3,Andy
"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.",3,4,Dwight
"Thanks, Michael. Wait, what is this?",5,22,Dwight
"Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.",5,1,Angela
"Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",1,2,Michael
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.,7,2,Pam
So you don't want to end our relationship?,3,14,Michael
No.,5,6,Michael
You've already been several times.,4,11,Dwight
Well no harm no foul.,5,17,Michael
You know let me give you some money for this.,5,12,Michael
"This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.",9,22,Dwight

Shhh... just calm down.,5,10,Michael
"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.",8,19,Jim
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.,7,23,Dwight
"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. What?!",8,6,Dwight
Have a seat.,5,24,Michael
Nice outfit.,3,6,Kevin
Ask how he's doing since the breakup.,5,6,Pam
"Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I’m switching over.",9,12,Darryl
"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.",7,12,Dwight
It's Grotti. He's following up.,6,5,Michael
Woo!,3,19,Michael
"Yeah, what's the reason?",8,4,Phyllis
Assistant team manager?,1,5,Dwight
"I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.",8,2,Erin
I don't know. I think Michael has a date.,6,6,Pam
I won't look at it.,8,11,Ryan
"If I was offensive in any way, I...",2,14,Dwight
I don't have anybody.,4,10,Pam
"No, my heels aren't too high. It’s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. Sorry Phyllis. You didn’t know. As long as I can get to the altar.",9,23,Angela
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.,3,22,Michael
For the insurance money! I knew it all along! You will never get away with this!,7,16,Michael
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!,4,4,Pam
"I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. Do you know, um, ""Goodbye Stranger""? Supertramp?",4,14,Michael
Who is it? Who's the birthday?,1,4,Michael
"Come on. Okay, um... That's as clear as I can make it.",7,1,Michael
She probably a t--,3,20,Andy
"Well, this could be fun. I-",8,8,Phyllis
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.,2,4,Michael
"What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.",3,16,Dwight
Buddha.,5,17,Michael
Leave.,8,7,Jim
"Yeah, you know me.",2,1,Dwight
"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",7,11,Michael
"You know, I just think you should know that-",8,18,Jim
"All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.",2,1,Dwight
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.,6,19,Andy
"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, ""I will when you lose the baby weight.""",6,22,Pam
Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.,3,19,Dwight
Hup!,5,22,Michael
"Hey, come inside and talk to me.",2,11,Angela
"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",6,7,Michael
"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.",5,17,Michael
OK...,3,20,Michael
"Oh, there he goes.",5,20,Jim
You'll fall in love with her.,5,12,Dwight
You may have...,7,4,Dwight
A woman spurned.,3,5,Michael
"I'm not really sick. Nah, I'm good.",4,1,Michael
Never mind. Just never mind.,6,23,Dwight
...for Phone. What?,2,4,Michael

We didn't have one scheduled.,8,8,Jim
I type 90.,3,5,Pam
"Shh, here she comes!",8,20,Kevin
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.,1,1,Dwight
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,2,11,Dwight
"Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.",5,5,Dwight
Billy Joel Rock Band.,6,23,Jim
Sounds like it.,8,23,Pam
"Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says ""Creed.""",5,4,Michael
"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",2,8,Jim
"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",3,9,Michael
Okay.,1,4,Michael
It was there when I sat down.,2,16,Jim
"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",6,21,Pam
"No, it's lettuce.",5,4,Phyllis
"Oh man, do you think it was stolen?",6,5,Kevin
"White, because it contains all other colors.",3,23,Andy
They're not getting married. It's just talk.,6,1,Phyllis
I think you look nice.Michael and,4,13,Pam
"Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I’m having.",8,2,Angela
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!,9,18,Angela
"I would like your undivided attention, please.",6,18,Michael
"Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...",4,11,Michael
"Yep, it's English, it's ""impossible.""",3,11,Jim
"It was Andy, wasn't it?",6,20,Erin
She's not gonna say no.,7,18,Pam
Phyllis!  Wow.,9,8,Jim
"Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.",9,3,Darryl
He says he doesn’t want to.,9,22,Pam
"Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico’s at 730.",9,3,Pam
"Oh no, we're just sitting here.",4,2,Jim
You are so brave. You are so brave.,2,12,Michael
"Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.",7,14,Jim
"If she is, it's working.",6,21,Michael
Didn't see that coming.,3,6,Andy
"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",6,3,Jim
"Oh, Michael...",5,15,Pam
"It’s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I’m stuck here trying to keep him on board.",9,12,Jim
"Wow, that's impressive.",5,16,Pam
"Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.",5,7,Dwight
"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",2,20,Michael
Can't do that. Unsanitary.,4,14,Jim
"Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.",2,18,Michael
"We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.",3,1,Michael
"Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .",2,4,Jim
"The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.",3,17,Dwight
"Haha, Mrs. Schrute.",5,9,Dwight
Hup!,5,22,Michael
"Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.",3,21,Dwight
"I love you, Jan.",3,17,Michael
Could I stick it with a pin?,5,14,Michael
"Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.",4,5,Michael
"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.",6,21,Dwight
"It’s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.",9,7,Erin
Ok.,5,18,Michael
"Oh, that must've been so fun.",5,9,Pam
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.,8,12,Darryl
"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have?",5,12,Michael
Perfect.,5,6,Jim
Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?,9,23,Jim
"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.",4,12,Michael
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?,6,9,Dwight
You know this can't go on.,5,11,Michael
"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!",7,14,Dwight
he's a historian.,8,8,Oscar
How much longer is this going to take?,5,12,Dwight
"'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",3,12,Andy
So about this proposal thing...,7,18,Pam
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.,7,20,Phyllis
"Here's her carrier, but no Cece.Jim's",7,7,Phyllis
"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",4,12,Michael
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.,6,9,Oscar
"Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.Receptionitis15 Where?JIM9334 The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock.Receptionitis15 Alright. See you there. ) P.S. I finally finished my summer project.",5,1,Dwight
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?,3,10,Dwight
Rut ti doh doh...,9,16,Andy
I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.,4,5,Michael
Let's go.,2,22,Dwight
"I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.",2,5,Dwight
Okay.,5,20,Michael
Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!,9,7,Dwight
"Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.",2,2,Michael
But you know I wouldn’t hire any of these all-stars.,9,13,Jim
"Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...",1,6,Dwight
"Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?",5,19,Pam
I was aware that you were speaking.,4,4,Dwight
Way to go.,5,20,Dwight
Her nephew's in Iraq.,2,17,Phyllis
"Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.",7,4,Oscar
Is there no way we can get rid of him?,5,8,Michael
"This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.",5,1,Michael
"You know I can, my man.",3,9,Andy
Alright.,6,4,Jim
"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.",3,7,Dwight
"Hi, David.",9,7,Jim
You really want Packer as your boss?,8,16,Dwight
"You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.",8,16,Dwight
Well-,5,18,Michael

"Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first.",3,20,Michael
"Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... Hello? Pretty good.",3,12,Andy
"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.",5,17,Pam
"What did they do to you, Angela?",9,8,Dwight
Good night.,8,1,Dwight
"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",6,22,Michael
"That’s pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?",8,2,Jim
"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.Party guests No, pop it. Pop it!",8,20,Andy
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.,5,17,Michael
"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.",5,9,Michael
"Well we can do better than that.Ad guy 2 Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.Ad guy 1 Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.",4,5,Michael
Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.,3,18,Michael
Why don't you go do some work?,6,16,Pam
"It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.",3,16,Oscar
"Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.",6,19,Dwight
"What’s it now, dream or no dream?",9,21,Phyllis
What kind of filing?,2,20,Dwight
"If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.",8,16,Dwight
Yeah.,6,6,Michael
"Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.",8,4,Andy
"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? Hey. Hi, sorry.",6,14,Michael
"No, you just have little dainty fingers.",5,16,Pam
"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.",4,1,Pam
We can move out.,7,10,Pam
"No, it is not.",5,18,Michael
Are you asleep?,5,14,Pam
"Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --",5,6,Dwight
Where do I want to go?,2,17,Jim
"No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.",9,9,Dwight

"Dwight, little help with the bags, please.",4,10,Michael
"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.",6,8,Michael
"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?Mr.",1,2,Michael
"I have two sure things, one wildcard.",5,4,Michael
Yeah.,2,9,Michael
"Oh. Thank you, Kelly . And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.",3,20,Angela
"Pam, what are you?",9,5,Erin
"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.

"What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",5,9,Michael
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.,2,3,Jim
"Seven, two...",7,23,Angela

"Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",6,20,Andy

You can call. Can you call 'em?,2,5,Michael
"Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. I'm Erin.",8,10,Erin
"Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.",9,4,Dwight

"No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.",5,19,Pam
"I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.",8,6,Dwight
"And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.",5,7,Michael
Send me a picture.,4,10,Michael
Earlier today.,6,12,Michael

Some breakfast for me and some breakfast for you.,7,16,Michael
"I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.",4,14,Phyllis
"You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.",8,12,Jim
"New York real estate. I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon. It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home. It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom. I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College. He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry. So, win/win.",3,23,Michael

That's what makes him classy.,5,18,Michael

What's that?,4,7,Jim
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.,7,7,Jim

Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.,3,4,Angela
Was it?,7,12,Jim
"In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.",9,9,Dwight
I'm trying everything.,7,9,Jim
I'm breathing heavily.,4,6,Dwight
You need my pitchfork?,9,14,Dwight

"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.",6,1,Michael
Are you kidding? You wait.,2,10,Darryl
"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?",3,7,Dwight
Striker!,5,20,Jim
'Cause I could look it up real easily.,1,6,Dwight
It will just take a second.,1,6,Dwight
"Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman. I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see. And, um, it's uncomfortable. So maybe I do understand.",3,21,Michael
Thank you. Thank you very much.,1,2,Dwight

They need to be presented... royally... anyone?,4,9,Michael
"Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.",3,16,Michael

"'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.",6,19,Andy
It was an away game.,9,2,Jim
"There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, ""What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?"" He said, ""If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.""",4,11,Pam
What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.,8,18,Darryl
"Okay, I will think about it.",4,12,Michael
Made copies of it-,2,7,Dwight
You're good to talk to.,5,13,Pam
This is illegal.,2,6,Angela
"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.",2,3,Michael
"No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.",2,11,Michael
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,2,10,Michael
"I love you guys, so much.",4,2,Michael
What for?,5,21,Michael
Ryan?,4,11,Michael
"Slow down, think it over.",4,4,Darryl
"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",7,15,Michael
"In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.",9,21,Dwight
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.,7,13,Andy
"Wow. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend.",6,14,Michael
"I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.",3,20,Phyllis
Are you okay?,6,8,Pam
You left us without saying goodbye.,9,22,Erin
"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.",9,10,Jim
"Hey, what was she like?",6,4,Dwight
Actor?,9,19,Andy
Are you pulling my leg or...,2,5,Michael
Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.,2,9,Pam
"No, you stop.",8,12,Dwight
You have no clue why I've asked you in here?,2,5,Michael
I love their breadsticks!,7,20,Phyllis
Uh huh.,3,5,Michael
No you can't baby! Good luck.,9,20,Angela
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.,4,13,Michael

Yes I will.,4,3,Andy
"Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?",5,19,Angela
Yes.,2,6,Michael
"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",7,6,Michael
"Pregnant, no.",9,16,Pam
It's from Battlestar Galactica.,2,22,Dwight
O-kay. Hello Jan.,4,14,Michael
Sic him!,4,1,Phyllis
"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",6,22,Michael
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.,7,11,Dwight
Bring it.,5,5,Dwight
What's the matter... haaaww!,5,8,Michael
Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!,3,3,Michael
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?,5,1,Michael
I'm losing control of my bladder.,4,6,Dwight
Time!,4,9,Andy
Who would want it?,6,4,Kevin
"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.",6,23,Jim
"He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.",7,10,Oscar
"Enter Sandman, Metallica.",5,21,Dwight
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,2,21,Dwight
"Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not.",5,23,Angela
"Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.",2,22,Pam
It's supposed to say launch!,4,3,Angela
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.,9,6,Darryl
"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",7,6,Michael
"What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work? Would that be crossing the line?",2,2,Michael
Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?,4,10,Michael
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,6,3,Jim
"Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.",5,5,Michael
Very very smart.,7,4,Andy
Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!,5,13,Michael
I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Just saying.,9,21,Jim
"As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.",3,10,Jim
"Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.",6,16,Michael
"Yeah, he is that good-looking.",7,5,Michael
"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!",7,11,Dwight
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.",1,4,Pam
There’s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –,9,13,Jim
"Angela, what about you?",2,20,Dwight
"You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.",8,13,Kevin
Stop it. Stop! What is that?,2,19,Michael
"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.",7,11,Pam
"Yeah, I guess I could.",9,18,Pam
Do I have any messages?,3,7,Michael
"Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.",7,19,Jim
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.,6,10,Erin
Did you talk to him?,6,23,Pam
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.,8,11,Kevin
The Electric City. Scranton!,6,13,Michael
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.,4,2,Michael
Does and email count?,6,10,Kevin
"Oh, right, yeah.",4,10,Pam
"No, hmmm... that's still...",6,23,Dwight
"Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.",6,19,Michael
Dwight tried to kiss me.,2,21,Jim
Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.,6,16,Jim
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?,3,22,Michael
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?,7,11,Andy
"Really? That’s interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who’s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",9,13,Dwight
Take care of my wife. I will be back.,9,13,Jim
"Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.",7,19,Pam
"Okay, all right.",3,22,Michael
That's disgusting.,3,16,Oscar
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.,8,6,Phyllis
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.,6,18,Dwight
"Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic.",5,8,Phyllis
That was really rough.,7,15,Jim
It’s from the teapot. Everything you’ll ever need to know is in that note. Not enough for me? You are everything.,9,22,Jim
Sure.,5,8,Pam
I'm just getting hardcore with him.,5,22,Michael
Zip your lid!,3,23,Dwight
Kathy.,8,14,Dwight
"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",8,7,Dwight
"Oh, hey guys.",7,3,Michael
Hi Donna. It's Michael.,7,4,Michael
"No, I got it.",3,16,Jim
Are you interested in her?,2,14,Jim
"Right to voicemail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!",4,14,Jim
"How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.",6,2,Andy
And the neighbors blamed Jan.,4,9,Michael
"Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.",9,18,Jim
What are you guys going to do?,1,6,Pam
"Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?",4,14,Jim
"Let's do it, shoot it.",8,24,Jim
Score.,2,13,Pam
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.,6,3,Jim
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?,9,6,Erin
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!,7,12,Michael
He --,5,6,Dwight
"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.",5,18,Jim
"Just to say ""sterile"" doesn't make it so.",5,19,Oscar
I should step into sales myself.,6,15,Oscar
I bet she had hairy armpits.,6,4,Dwight
I took a lot from other poems.,5,1,Michael
Just... don't answer that call!,5,20,Kevin
I flipped through it.,8,2,Pam
So what did I miss?,4,7,Michael
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. There you are.,9,9,Dwight
What's it of?,3,11,Dwight
"Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.",4,6,Dwight
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.,5,20,Jim
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.,4,1,Dwight
"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?",4,5,Andy
I’m losing my balance.,9,22,Kevin
"Okay, what does that mean?",5,11,Michael
Michael? Poor Richard's?,2,10,Oscar
Finally! That old shredder sucked.,7,21,Kevin
Five.,3,16,Jim
Meredith Van Helsing?,7,5,Jim
What makes them so good?,3,5,Michael
"No, can't.",4,4,Jim
"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",7,17,Dwight
I definitely remember your dinner party.,4,10,Pam
That's not good.,5,12,Dwight
Is this yours or mine?,6,17,Jim
"Dwight, get out of here!",2,1,Phyllis
I think it was Creed.,6,3,Dwight
"It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.",8,12,Jim
"Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.",9,8,Phyllis
"I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-",8,15,Jim
"Shhh, Pam. C’mon, don’t be such a right-sider.",8,1,Dwight
Come on. You got this. Here.,9,19,Erin
"Well, congrats.",6,4,Jim
Are you sure you don't want to play?,2,3,Pam
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.,2,18,Michael
"Oh, big time.",6,6,Michael
I'm all over it.,4,3,Pam
Okay.,5,7,Michael
Yes.,2,18,Michael
"C’mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?",8,1,Andy
You love drama.,6,19,Erin
"Yeah, he is.",6,7,Pam
"Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. 'Cause of the...",2,18,Pam
"Yeah, I got stung up my dress.",7,4,Phyllis
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,9,15,Jim
"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.",6,16,Pam
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah.,8,15,Dwight
"Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.",7,14,Michael
I can see you!,5,1,Pam
"Oh, no you di-int.",2,1,Michael
You know what Erin you do have to.,7,8,Michael
"Okay, let's go.",5,13,Dwight
"Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...",9,3,Jim
"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",6,22,Michael
"Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.",5,11,Angela
"We are, we are a family.",5,13,Michael
"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.",5,13,Dwight
See ya.,6,9,Jim
"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",3,8,Michael
"Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.",2,10,Michael
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.,8,8,Andy
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,8,10,Andy
Hey Mike.,3,7,Darryl
No. You will not.Woman in line Excuse me?,6,10,Dwight
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.,8,8,Andy
Ok. thanks.,9,6,Andy
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.,8,6,Pam
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.,3,22,Michael
"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.",4,8,Pam
"Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.",9,16,Erin
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.,4,1,Ryan
"Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",8,12,Dwight
And we have sex on it.,5,4,Michael
"There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",3,4,Michael
Let's do this thing.,5,1,Dwight
"It could be snacks, or-",5,15,Oscar
"I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn’t help.",8,3,Andy
Hey. What are you doing?,7,1,Pam
"All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",4,7,Michael
"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.",7,7,Michael
"Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.",9,23,Darryl
What? Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!,2,9,Pam
"I don't know, I don't know.",6,14,Jim
Yes.,7,5,Michael
"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",5,13,Michael
"Yeah, yeah me too. I think it’d be like… You know what? I think it’d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot… Perfecto! Oh my god…",9,11,Darryl
To ask for directions..,6,2,Pam
"Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.",1,3,Jim
They're important.,2,7,Phyllis
"So you'll be reporting to me, then.",3,8,Dwight
"Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",5,24,Jim
"OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use uh, oh -- Snoopy.",5,6,Jim
"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...",3,2,Jim
"Um, Ok. Well?",9,18,Pam
"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.",8,14,Andy
You have stress?,5,13,Michael
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,3,2,Pam
I'll get him water.,7,12,Oscar
"Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.",3,7,Michael
"Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.",7,15,Kevin
I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?,6,8,Ryan
"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.",8,13,Andy
"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",8,10,Jim
Exactly that.,6,18,Michael
"Uh-huh. Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. Here he is.",5,18,Michael
This is flatter.,9,20,Kevin
"400, 400 hey batter batter.",5,4,Michael
How's everybody doing?!,7,9,Ryan
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.,7,18,Kevin
"Kev, have a good weekend.",3,18,Jim
That was hilarious. The foam ...,3,7,Michael
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.,3,4,Kevin
Push it.,1,2,Michael
"You don’t need to repeat right now, when I’m saying it.",9,22,Dwight
"""Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV.""",6,4,Dwight
"Sure, if you are.",6,19,Erin
"And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!",3,19,Michael
"Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.",5,26,Dwight
"Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. Mmm. Mmm.  I'm the Godfather. I'm gonna eat this whole pizza. And then I'm gonna kill you.  some cheese. You gotta fold it up. That's the way you eat pizza.",5,4,Michael
"Ah, let's do it. Oh, that's healthy.",8,15,Jim
Oh really? Was anyone killed?,7,4,Michael
Well put it aside.  Umm... yeah.,4,10,Michael
"Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.",7,23,Dwight
What suggestion box?,2,8,Pam
"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.",3,11,Dwight
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,8,6,Jim
"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",2,5,Michael
Mmmm.,1,2,Pam
That is true.,5,12,Michael
"Cookie. Kevin, cookie.",5,25,Michael
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?,7,24,Kevin
"Ok guys, “we all drink them all”.",9,11,Kevin
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.,6,23,Pam
Pretty Woman.,7,2,Andy
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.,4,3,Dwight
"Hey, I was thinking about dinner---",4,4,Pam
"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",3,11,Pam
"There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.",5,23,Dwight
"Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?",5,21,Pam
"I don't care either way, so....shut up.",5,5,Andy
"Hey, have you guys seen her?",6,16,Andy
"Yeah, but no nipples.",8,5,Dwight
"If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity?",1,4,Dwight
I said it normal.,4,3,Pam
Yeah. No. Good.,3,22,Jim
"Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.",7,12,Andy
I can't wait to be a father. I'm going to smother that baby.,5,1,Michael
"Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.",9,9,Jim
"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",5,13,Andy
"Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.",2,5,Dwight
Is it a good plan?,1,3,Michael
"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.",4,1,Michael
You should put butter on it.,2,12,Oscar
That's a communal bowl.,2,13,Pam
You know Michael's been talking to her too.,1,6,Pam
"No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...",3,20,Michael
“Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.”,9,18,Jim
"I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!",7,8,Kevin
Wow.,2,4,Jim
"Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.",5,13,Darryl
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.,1,5,Darryl
"Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.",4,14,Phyllis
So don't.,8,13,Dwight
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!,5,9,Angela
"Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.",6,24,Andy
"Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.",5,4,Michael
"Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.",3,8,Jim
"I, barely know him...",2,12,Angela
"So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. ""Very interesting, but stupid."" Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.",1,1,Michael
"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",3,11,Pam
"That’s—that’s what—yeah. Okay, all right, well, here’s the song. Far above Cayuga’s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater—",9,22,Andy
"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",2,5,Michael
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I’m gonna thank people.,8,2,Andy
Well-,5,3,Michael
"Oh, don’t lie. I’m trying to save those precious knees you’re always bragging about.  Now, let’s get out of here. He could be right behind us.",9,8,Dwight
What?,2,2,Michael
No you weren't.,7,15,Ryan
"There's about 30 news alerts for ""Nip Slip.""",6,11,Erin
That a couple of times-,8,21,Pam
"I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?",2,13,Michael
"Michael, stop.",6,15,Pam
"Don't encourage him, Dwight.",3,9,Angela
One. Two. Three. Shot!,3,6,Andy
"You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",6,6,Dwight
Back to work.,1,1,Michael
Why do you wanna work here?Male Applicant 1 I need a job.,8,3,Darryl
"Enough Oscar, enough.",8,9,Angela
"Six-seventy, six-twenty.",8,6,Angela
"I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---",3,18,Darryl
Mm-mm,5,1,Angela
You want me to be happy?,6,6,Michael
"Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.",7,12,Kevin
Yeah. That does not feel good.,8,6,Jim
"No, Michael, you were sabotaged.",5,22,Dwight
There is no story.,8,5,Oscar
Whoopi Goldberg.,8,5,Ryan
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,3,8,Jim
Just goes to show the power of prayer.,3,16,Angela
Is there more wine in the kitchen?,4,9,Pam
They could be shrinking.,5,12,Michael
"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.",6,17,Dwight
"Hurry, we have to make this fast.",5,1,Angela
The Electric City. Scranton!,6,13,Michael
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.,8,14,Darryl
"Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.",6,9,Michael

"I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.",5,19,Pam
Well get on it. And make it happen.,3,14,Michael

We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.,2,12,Jim
"Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?",4,1,Oscar

"I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",5,6,Jim
"Well, Carla knows.",7,7,Andy
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?,9,10,Angela
You all right? What’s going on?,9,22,Jim
"I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.",4,14,Michael
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.,5,25,Michael
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn’t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,9,13,Dwight
"I have been saying the word ""manager"" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks ""manager"" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",6,15,Michael
Hello.,6,19,Michael
Which me am I gonna be today?,7,5,Andy

"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.",5,18,Dwight
"Then listen to your iPod, Pam.",5,14,Michael
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?,6,8,Dwight
"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.",2,3,Dwight
"Kevin, stay.",5,25,Michael
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",5,23,Michael
"Oh, huggy hugs.",2,12,Dwight

"All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?",9,8,Dwight
Hello Angela.,4,14,Phyllis
"Uh, no. It’s o…thank you. You know what? You don’t have to…oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It’s okay.",9,23,Angela
"Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.",5,1,Jim
"Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.",7,18,Dwight
"OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.",9,4,Dwight

I'm in too.,8,8,Phyllis
This aurea is a joke.,6,6,Andy
Oh you did?,2,13,Jim
"Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.",2,4,Michael
Cool. Cool. OK.,2,16,Ryan
That's not what I had in mind.,3,20,Andy
That is how you do it.,7,18,Michael
I have yet another sales order for you to sign.,9,15,Dwight
"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",2,6,Jim
But you said you were in debt.,3,23,Angela
"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",6,17,Michael
You pet the animals and they pet you back.,5,18,Jim
"Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.",5,1,Michael
"Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.",6,19,Michael
Exactly!,4,2,Michael
"And, ditto.",2,6,Michael
I'm going... to the dentist.,3,3,Dwight
What do you want us to do?,6,14,Pam
"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",7,15,Michael

I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one?,5,7,Oscar
"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it.

Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",2,16,Michael
"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.",4,9,Michael
Was that not the--,8,19,Jim
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,7,10,Dwight

"Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.",8,10,Erin
Nice!,7,20,Kevin
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?,6,5,Oscar
"Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.",5,9,Angela

"Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?",1,6,Michael
"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.",5,13,Dwight
"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?",9,15,Andy
Brava!,7,21,Oscar
"Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.",5,1,Andy
It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.,7,21,Pam
Take it easy.,1,5,Jim
"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.",2,20,Michael
No one's moving!,8,15,Jim
"I'll be back, I mean...",2,12,Dwight
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.,2,11,Michael
Are you authorized to do this?,7,8,Angela
"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.",8,11,Dwight
Yup...,4,11,Jim

He is a goner.,3,4,Dwight
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.,5,9,Oscar
"Hey guys, the tree's here.",7,11,Pam
"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead."" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.",1,3,Dwight
Is this spicy?,8,16,Angela
I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.,5,3,Pam

I thought it might make me feel better.,7,9,Michael
"Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?",6,13,Michael
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.,1,6,Dwight

"It's nice to see you again, Dwight.Dwight. Hello, Pam.",6,20,Pam
"All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between ""A"" gym and ""B"" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm. Should we go?",6,11,Michael
What is that? A squid's eye or...,3,8,Michael
But I don't understand. It's for managers.,3,2,Angela
Close it.,7,18,Andy
"I'm kidding around. We joke about that stuff all the time. I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen. I care a little.",4,6,Pam
"All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?",8,24,Andy
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,3,5,Pam
"Yep, I did say that.",9,9,Jim
"Alright, a plan it is.",6,9,Andy
What are you doing with my lunch?,8,7,Darryl
"Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.",2,6,Oscar

"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.",7,5,Michael
"This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.",6,7,Angela

Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.,5,12,Michael
"Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.",7,12,Erin
I have my per diem. I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.,5,7,Michael
"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.",7,1,Andy
"Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?",2,13,Dwight

So close. So close.,2,22,Michael
"F and C, doubletime?",3,20,Ryan
Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,6,1,Andy
You have a very important call.,8,7,Erin
"Um. Ok, bye.",3,5,Pam
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.,6,22,Michael
There's one more suggestion.,2,8,Dwight
"There's a ""Shrek"" two?!",7,13,Erin
"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex. I'm just saying, at least right here is cursed. Conference room, 10 minutes.",4,1,Michael
"Okay, someone look it up.",7,10,Jim
He sees it.,2,8,Pam
Keep. I will finish that later.,2,13,Michael
"I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.",3,3,Jim
"Oh, yeah.",2,5,Jim
Huh- Does she ever talk about me?,5,15,Michael
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,8,13,Jim
Yeah! Let’s do it!,9,3,Erin
"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",6,14,Jim
I don't.,5,8,Michael
Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! Are you nauseous?,4,14,Michael
"Nope, nope, nope.",5,23,Michael
Who is that monkey?,5,7,Dwight
"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.",2,5,Michael
"You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.",6,2,Darryl
"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",2,5,Jim
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.,5,11,Jim
"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.",2,3,Michael
"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!",4,5,Andy
Is he looking? Oh. You can stop.,8,12,Erin
"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",7,1,Michael
"Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?",1,6,Michael
"Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?",5,14,Andy
What's happening to you Michael?,6,2,Phyllis
What was that stuff?,9,23,Kevin
"Ok. Yeah, what, what?",2,8,Michael
I got mine. They were really good.,5,6,Andy
"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...",7,17,Andy
"If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.",8,24,Darryl
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!,8,3,Erin
"Hey, sorry everybody.",5,1,Jim
That's hilarious. What's her number?,4,10,Michael
What's the dealio?,2,21,Michael
"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.",3,12,Andy
No it ain't.,6,9,Michael
"Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.",4,6,Jim
"Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?",7,5,Andy
"Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--",6,4,Andy
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.,3,16,Ryan
"Get up here, Dwight.",2,3,Michael
"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",9,13,Jim
It just doesn't add up.,6,2,Dwight
"No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.",8,18,Jim
"Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.",4,4,Ryan
"No, I wanna seduce her.",5,12,Dwight
It doesn't matter.,7,7,Andy
"Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.",8,9,Oscar
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.,3,19,Pam
"""900 to 1000, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE log. Lost log. Found log."" ""1000 to 1100, light salad, three points."" That's on the wrong page.",3,5,Michael
"Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.",3,21,Michael
"I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.",9,2,Pam
Orientation is over.,8,14,Dwight
Nn--- Depression.,3,19,Michael
"That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.",5,11,Oscar
How is it my fault?,9,13,Jim
"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.",6,5,Andy
"Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...",2,16,Michael
"So, how’s it going?",9,12,Pam
"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",6,22,Michael
Why are you still here?,9,23,Pam
I didn't really get a good look.,3,21,Phyllis
"Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...",7,10,Dwight
Oscar! Think abou- Think!,7,4,Michael
"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.",9,13,Darryl
How long were you guys together?,6,20,Erin
I'll have to talk to the manager.,3,23,Dwight
"Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.",5,26,Dwight
"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",2,10,Jim
Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.,7,18,Pam
It's Angela and Oscar.,9,18,Angela
"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.",9,22,Dwight
"Hey Martin, how's it going?",3,9,Michael
I got her!,5,25,Dwight
We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?,5,1,Ryan
"No, not without a ""please.""",6,3,Jim
"Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-",2,8,Michael
It's a pen.,6,22,Jim
"Well, I am heading down there.",6,17,Michael
"Um, yes. Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA",6,5,Kevin
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.,5,15,Michael
"Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it? Excuse me.",9,6,Andy
"I’d have to get some more wire and string, but it’s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?",9,22,Dwight
How dare you?,9,16,Dwight
"Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",2,12,Jim
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,5,11,Michael
"Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?",2,4,Jim
"Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.",5,10,Phyllis
"No, I can do it.",4,5,Michael
Um... also--,6,4,Ryan
Because you’re sitting?,8,9,Jim
"No, I know you are.",5,20,Pam
"Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",3,23,Dwight
Huh?,3,10,Ryan
"Michael, you shouldn't have done that.",6,16,Jim
Okay.,7,3,Michael
"If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.",7,9,Andy
Wanna head back?,4,3,Michael
Half.,5,5,Jim
"Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.",7,24,Angela
"Oh, Michael.",3,16,Pam
"I'm not seeing anything under ""confirmation.""",6,15,Dwight
"Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?",6,1,Michael
Let's single...,3,19,Dwight
"Well, I wish for a million wishes.",7,10,Kevin
Keep simulating.,5,3,Michael
"Toby, come on. Let's go.",3,18,Michael
I deserved that.,9,4,Jim
"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.",7,15,Michael
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.,3,19,Michael
"Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.",3,23,Michael
"Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!",2,4,Dwight
"Is it her boobs, or...",2,13,Michael
Yeah.,4,1,Michael
I can't do it.,4,3,Angela
"Jim, are you serious?",8,7,Dwight
"I didn’t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It’s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It’d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I’m a tragic person. I’m really happy now. But…it would just…just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself “be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn’t that long.”",9,23,Pam
"Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!",3,19,Dwight
That’s how I got my new job in the admissions office.,9,23,Andy
"Basically I couldn’t tell, but I think...",9,8,Pam
"Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.",3,18,Kevin
Their bread's really good.,1,4,Kevin
Good. Real good.,7,12,Dwight
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?,7,24,Phyllis
Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.,8,2,Kevin
"Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?",6,14,Michael
"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",2,17,Michael
"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",6,11,Michael
Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?,4,3,Michael
"Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.",3,20,Andy
I like the wild card. I'm already liking the wild card.,5,4,Jim
"Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?",3,14,Pam
"It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ‘Monster Mash.’ I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!",9,5,Kevin
"Mush, mush, mush! Come on!",8,12,Erin
Hmm.,6,16,Pam
"We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.",9,14,Angela
"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?",1,2,Michael
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.,7,19,Michael
"All right, just...",3,8,Michael
"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.",1,4,Jim
Why?,5,14,Michael
"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.",4,8,Michael
"Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.",9,3,Andy
I think you're a nice guy too.,4,8,Michael
Why'd you stop it?,6,7,Angela
"Hello hello!Ad guy 1 Hey, how ya doin'?",4,5,Michael
Is it criminal?,7,11,Andy
"Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend.",3,18,Pam
Seems like...,5,11,Andy
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.,8,23,Andy
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.,6,11,Erin
Good me too!,7,8,Erin
"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.",7,15,Michael
"Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.",6,4,Andy
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.,2,6,Michael
Ahh come on!,4,12,Michael
There’s nothing down here.,9,12,Pam
"Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.",2,9,Michael
So happy hour.,6,19,Oscar
"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.",4,1,Dwight
You paid for it?,4,1,Jim
"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.",7,11,Michael
"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",1,3,Dwight
What?,3,4,Michael
You guys came. Where’s everyone else?,8,8,Andy
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.,7,5,Michael
"The Beets Motel? That is, wow.",4,4,Jim
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,2,15,Pam
"I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. Take me hooo…hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing… no traditions!",8,6,Andy
"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.",4,2,Dwight
"Uh, it's a sketch now.",5,26,Michael
"I know you are. Knock, knock.",5,17,Michael
Nobody tell him!,4,5,Jim
"What... Ryan, where did you get this picture?",7,18,Oscar
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...,7,17,Jim
"Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.",3,17,Michael
"It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.",5,22,Jim
I would prefer not to.,5,19,Jim
"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don’t know. I’m working on something.",9,23,Pam
"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.",2,10,Michael
We can spend a couple days there.,5,22,Ryan
Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.,9,15,Andy
"Wait a minute, what is this?",2,3,Jim
"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.",1,4,Michael
"Re-suture. Sutures, yes.",3,23,Andy
It's just for family.,6,4,Dwight
"Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.",4,6,Jim
Shut up. That's impossible.,3,2,Dwight
Here for what?,4,2,Andy
"Michael, it's really not a competition.",3,2,Jim
I'm right here.,4,11,Angela
It's her first try.,3,16,Oscar
Yes.,6,10,Michael
"Oh, you don't want to know.",3,21,Jim
Yeah. Sorry.,3,14,Pam
"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.",3,3,Pam
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,3,8,Dwight
Then what was this all about?,7,24,Phyllis
"I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.",7,6,Angela
"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?",1,3,Jim
Let me check. Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.,5,21,Dwight
Hi Jan.,5,1,Kevin
Which is it more of?,6,3,Michael
"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",3,22,Michael
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.,4,8,Michael
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.,8,11,Andy
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.,7,5,Dwight
"Well, the alert was already set to “Red” because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to “Double Red”?",9,19,Dwight
"I can't let you in, Michael.",3,15,Dwight
"Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.",8,21,Ryan
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!,2,11,Michael
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.,6,19,Angela
"Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.",3,21,Phyllis
"Hey, alright.",6,18,Jim
"Psssh, no.",1,3,Dwight
Yep...,6,6,Jim
Also good.,5,5,Jim
"I wasn't acc-, accusing...",7,24,Andy
Go on. I have warm blood.,6,18,Erin
That's how it works!,6,5,Andy
"...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.",3,9,Pam
I'm inventing new diseases.,1,3,Pam
I'm in big trouble.,9,6,Oscar
Pfffffttt.,6,23,Michael
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work,6,18,Angela
OK. Here ya go.,9,14,Jim
"Wow, an ultimatum.",7,11,Pam
Does she smell?,8,22,Pam
"I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.",2,15,Phyllis
"God, what a steal.",2,3,Dwight
You could have just told us what you were thinking.,7,13,Pam
Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,6,22,Michael
You’re not going to get it though?,8,7,Erin
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,7,17,Michael
"Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.",8,1,Angela
"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.",4,9,Michael
"Pam! You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you?",4,4,Jim
... Thank you.,3,16,Pam
"This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.",6,1,Pam
"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.",3,4,Michael
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,3,8,Dwight
"Um, you know what, I actually didn’t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",9,23,Jim
"Umm, Michael.",2,9,Jim
"Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",6,4,Michael
"He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.",4,4,Pam
For both sides. Whoever paid more.,3,8,Pam
"So, I'm Erin. Hi.",8,20,Erin
"Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.",5,14,Andy
But the other one is. I've heard that before.,3,5,Ryan
"Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.",8,19,Andy
You’re working for “Stumpany” too?,9,12,Dwight
"Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.",3,17,Pam
OK,3,10,Michael
Frank and Beans. Always makes her laugh.,6,6,Jim
"Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.",2,13,Pam
I don’t know. I just don’t know.,9,5,Dwight
"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert’s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",9,13,Dwight
"They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.",5,17,Michael
"Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.",4,3,Dwight
"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",7,6,Michael
Waste of time.,8,16,Dwight
"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?Business Student #1 But in the big picture...",3,16,Michael
"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Jan, I defend your honor.  Is that all?",2,7,Michael
"All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.",1,5,Michael
"I'm good, I'm good.",5,23,Michael
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.,6,7,Michael
"Poor, poor Andy.",9,23,Phyllis
Oww!,4,1,Dwight
"Yes, I am, Charles.",5,20,Michael
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.,9,18,Pam
"Of course they have. Which is why I’m giving you a key to my house. Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by.Mr.",8,23,Andy
Yeah and we’re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you’d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.,8,7,Andy
"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",5,13,Pam
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.,6,7,Darryl
"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.",3,15,Dwight
"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you?",5,15,Dwight
Well...,4,2,Michael
"Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage?",4,14,Andy
Assistant to the managed him -,6,18,Michael
"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.",6,4,Jim
"Michael, why did you promise that?",6,11,Pam
"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",6,22,Michael
"I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, “Look, a balloon.”",8,19,Kevin
Who should I say is calling?,7,22,Erin
I got it. Alright.,6,16,Jim
"I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women.",8,13,Dwight
"Limbo, whoo!",2,11,Dwight
"Oh, my God! It's incredible. Is this the Boggle timer?",2,10,Pam
"Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.",5,5,Andy
You were lying.,5,6,Michael
"Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.",3,19,Ryan
"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.",3,10,Andy
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,4,2,Dwight
"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?",5,17,Michael
"No, not at all come on in. No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...",1,4,Michael
"Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.",5,6,Andy
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.,8,8,Dwight
Why are you looking at my forehead?,3,8,Dwight
Seems pretty well liked by the team.,6,23,Andy
"Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",5,10,Michael
Up high.,8,15,Andy
"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",3,23,Dwight
Look at that one.,3,21,Dwight
Oh. Drew. Sorry.,3,19,Pam
"Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?",5,15,Jim
Oh... Deshaun Williams.,7,24,Jim
"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that.",1,1,Michael
"Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.",4,14,Andy
"Ok, that's a joke.",2,7,Oscar
"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?",2,8,Dwight
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.,8,15,Erin
"Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America’s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It’s a really cool show, it’s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!",9,22,Andy
"Well, you shouldn’t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.",9,11,Pam
"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",3,7,Jim
"But off the record, I'm kinda confused.",6,1,Andy
"Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.",8,5,Erin
Shh shh shh shh.,2,12,Michael
Nick.,6,15,Ryan
You know what you're doing.,3,14,Ryan
"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",3,11,Michael
Tell me.,4,4,Michael
We could get Deangelo flowers.,7,23,Pam
"I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!",2,1,Pam
"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",2,21,Michael
"No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. You are all such wonderful, innocent people.",2,5,Michael
"Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.",5,22,Michael
"Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.",1,6,Michael
I'm... what? I didn't,3,6,Michael
"Now he is saying ""Hi"" louder.",5,1,Jim
"Yes, and there’s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.",9,1,Pam
"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.",9,16,Andy
"That's okay, Mike.",2,10,Darryl
"What’s up, guys? Just thought we’d have a little rap session, talk about business…see how things are going? Ahem…",8,2,Andy
I don't understand why you keep picking on me.,4,12,Michael
Drew. Dwight. How's it goin' man?,3,19,Andy
"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",2,3,Dwight
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?,7,18,Michael
What?,2,8,Michael
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?,6,15,Erin
"So, cool right?",7,11,Pam
"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",2,21,Michael
"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?",2,8,Michael
"Nothing, just talking.",5,19,Jim
"You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.",7,14,Michael
"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.",5,13,Michael
"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.",1,4,Michael
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.,7,20,Andy
Let's go in here.,7,18,Michael
"Okay, here we go. Here we go. Put it in.",4,14,Dwight
I'll take it.,9,4,Jim
You can't be in here!,2,1,Phyllis
"Oh, this looks promising.",3,8,Jim
"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.",8,13,Andy
This is just offensive.,3,19,Angela
"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.",5,12,Dwight
"Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. There’s plenty of Pyramids.",8,17,Dwight
"So, can I..?",1,6,Pam
So... what else is up? Mich-,4,13,Dwight
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,6,23,Jim
"What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.",2,2,Jim
"Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.",5,20,Jim
A ski mask and a swimsuit.,2,11,Pam
..The camera don't lie!,9,16,Andy
"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he’s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he’s hard to love, but did you know that he’s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?",8,1,Andy
I've had the worse day here,3,10,Angela
"Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.",3,19,Jim
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,6,3,Jim
"Dwight, you brought the mallard back.",6,6,Jim
"Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.",9,14,Kevin
"Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.",4,4,Michael
"Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.",3,2,Phyllis
"How's it going over here, guys?",8,4,Andy
So what do you think?,6,19,Jim
Agent Michael Scarn.,2,7,Jim
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.,6,14,Erin
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?,8,3,Andy
"I have no idea where we’re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.",9,12,Jim
"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!",2,11,Michael
Yes they were.,5,9,Michael
"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",9,16,Pam
"I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting ""Back to the Future."" ""Back"" because it's on my back and ""Future"" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie. Girl in",4,11,Michael
"Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper"" and get them to ""Show us the money!"" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?A.J. A.J.",5,15,Michael
"Huh. Well, you know, you can’t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what’s most important. That’s my new thing.",9,21,Jim
"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",2,21,Dwight
"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.",3,10,Jim
"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.",9,13,Dwight
I need to have her say...,6,22,Michael
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.,8,21,Dwight
So my looks have nothing to do with it?,2,8,Michael
"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.",8,18,Andy
"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",2,16,Dwight
Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!,5,26,Michael
"Nine days, though. That's, like...",7,9,Michael
That's what I said. That's what she said.,4,7,Michael
"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",3,21,Michael
"Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?",4,8,Pam
"Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.",7,24,Darryl
"Yes, Phyl?",6,16,Michael
Well I don't see that happening.,6,5,Andy
Yeah.,3,4,Michael
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.,9,3,Pam
"He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.",8,13,Oscar
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.,5,6,Dwight
Oh my God. Is that Jim's?,5,14,Michael
Last night? Let's see.,2,20,Pam
"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? Not real.",4,7,Michael
You set the bar so high.,6,8,Jim
'Morning. Wow. Good morning Dwight.,5,5,Ryan
"It’s ok E-Dog, just who called?",8,2,Darryl
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.,3,8,Jim
"Well, so what? Your body's a ten.",5,22,Andy
WOO! Alright!,5,2,Michael
You embarrassed me.,4,6,Jim
Will you help me put it over there?,4,3,Angela
It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.,5,17,Jim
Yes.,7,10,Michael
"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!",7,2,Dwight
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!,3,21,Michael
My pants fell down! I don’t have a belt!,8,23,Dwight
It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.,5,1,Michael
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.,9,10,Pam
It's the lining of the stomach of--,9,9,Phyllis
What are you guys talking about?Dwight and,2,15,Michael
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?,9,4,Dwight
I think you should get dressed.,5,20,Pam
"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-",6,11,Jim
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.,2,5,Michael
"Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-",5,21,Andy
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.,1,3,Pam
"Alright, in my defense...",6,6,Michael
"Yeah…um, how is everything?",8,2,Andy
Chocolates.,7,12,Erin
Okay...,7,21,Michael
"That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed.",7,10,Pam
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.,3,22,Michael
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.,8,14,Pam
Our question is—it seems dumb.,9,21,Kevin
"Whew, oh God. Laying a base. Laying a base...",4,14,Michael
Yeah. I have a question for you.,3,5,Jim
"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  What's this about?",6,2,Michael
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,3,8,Michael
You guys do a raffle?,3,10,Pam
It's up to you to change his mind.,5,6,Michael
"Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?",8,7,Darryl
Good! Fine! I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee...,4,5,Jim
"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",6,14,Michael
I'll see you tomorrow.,5,6,Pam
"Oh, Erin...",8,5,Pam
It’s 30 degrees out. You drinkin’ a mildshake?,9,12,Darryl
"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",6,9,Jim
"Why thank you very much. Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",5,17,Michael
"Oh. Great. We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",4,1,Michael
You're gonna compete against us?,2,14,Phyllis
"Oh, great. Oh, I’m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don’t have it.",9,7,Pam
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?,6,10,Jim
Interesting choice...,7,4,Dwight
Nope. His name is Michael.,5,13,Darryl
Hello.,7,13,Michael
"What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.",1,6,Michael
"Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.",5,26,Michael
Flonkerton.,2,3,Pam
I haven't been to New York in a long time.,3,18,Darryl
Well I’m just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don’t know the woman.,8,2,Kevin
"Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.",5,26,Jim
"For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.",5,5,Pam
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?,3,16,Ryan
Cannonball! Let's do this!,8,12,Darryl
"Just one. ""This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.""",8,21,Pam
Nice. Nice.,9,8,Kevin
Nothing new.,1,3,Pam
"It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called ""Curves."" I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",6,15,Michael
"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",2,13,Pam
"Get out of the way! Go, go, go!",5,13,Michael
"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.",2,22,Darryl
Not gonna change.,4,7,Jim
"Yes, it's totally obvious.",6,24,Pam
"Tonight, hopefully.",1,1,Jim
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.,2,17,Michael
"Well, it was an important phone call.",9,12,Pam
Watch and learn.,9,20,Dwight
"Ooh, about what?",7,23,Erin
Phillip got this for me?,9,22,Kevin
"Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.",2,4,Dwight
"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.",5,20,Michael
Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.,8,3,Jim
"Here is a Kelly complaint ""Ryan never returns my calls."" Ugh, join the club.",2,21,Michael
"Alright, I'll tell Dwight.",8,10,Andy
Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.,1,3,Michael
"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",8,13,Jim
"Hey, no.",9,22,Oscar
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...,6,21,Oscar
"That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.",7,15,Andy
And how many kitchens?,3,5,Jim
I'm all better.,2,20,Dwight
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.,4,2,Angela
"Andy’s coming back today! Andy’s coming back today! Ha! Andy’s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.",9,1,Erin
"You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.",5,24,Andy
Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.DunMiff/sys Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.DwightK,4,3,Jim
"Nope, that's Tuesday.",6,22,Michael
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.,2,4,Michael
I'm on it.,4,7,Dwight
Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!,3,3,Michael
"Watch this. Darryl, watch this.",5,5,Michael
That!,6,6,Dwight
"Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.",9,10,Pam
"I'm going to Florida to get Erin. Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!",8,18,Andy
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.,6,13,Dwight
They finally let you do it!,6,12,Oscar
"Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?",3,12,Andy
Thank vous. What? Oh!,5,4,Michael
"Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.",7,4,Dwight
Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.,6,1,Dwight
"Mmm-mm. I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.",4,9,Pam
"Chef from South Park, it's genius!",8,5,Andy
"Okay. Let's start with the ""I love you"" level.",4,14,Jim
"Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.",7,5,Andy
"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",6,16,Pam
Nobody better try to stop me. Good.,6,23,Michael
And Jim will say nothing.,9,23,Jim
"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.",2,11,Dwight
"Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on back... order... Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!",2,19,Dwight
Birthday hug!,2,19,Dwight
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!,9,4,Jim
"I think it's over, man.",6,21,Kevin
Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.,9,7,Erin
Who wants a hot chocolate?,6,6,Jim
Just shut up! I don't wanna hear anything more from you.,2,9,Michael
"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",8,3,Jim
"Wha, it's-",9,2,Andy
"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",4,2,Michael
"Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.",5,9,Oscar
"Uh, 24. 37.",5,14,Dwight
I'd like to try it.,3,22,Pam
So what are your credentials?,9,8,Angela
She does seem happy.,7,24,Pam
"I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...",4,1,Michael
What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.,8,3,Dwight
This is not what I want my relationship to look like.,6,19,Andy
I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.,7,15,Michael
"This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.",2,8,Michael
Yeah.,3,2,Michael
"But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch.  Thank you.",3,23,Dwight
Yes.,6,8,Michael
And that was our summer.,9,1,Pam
Anything else?,6,11,Jim
Put it down,9,16,Phyllis
"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",2,10,Michael
"Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",2,10,Michael
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.,5,21,Ryan
Total golf text. Send it.,8,14,Pam
What about my cherub figurine?,4,4,Angela
"You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?",7,12,Phyllis
I'll just go later.,5,1,Jim
"We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!",5,4,Michael
"Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.",3,19,Andy
"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",4,2,Michael
"Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?",6,2,Michael
"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?",8,11,Dwight
"Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.",8,16,Ryan
"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 600 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.",4,3,Michael
"I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.",9,4,Dwight
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...,3,8,Jim
Notice anything different about me?,8,14,Darryl
This. Ends. Now.,8,18,Dwight
"In Philly, so, that doesn’t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.",9,1,Jim
"There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!",4,14,Jim
"With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.",8,12,Ryan
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?,3,6,Phyllis
"I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?",8,11,Oscar
"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.",2,16,Michael
"We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's—I think she understands... what this is.",9,3,Jim
On his mother's grave.,1,1,Dwight
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...,7,24,Jim
"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.",2,12,Michael
Feel it against your cheek.,6,8,Andy
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,6,14,Pam
"I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.",2,17,Jim
"You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.",7,4,Dwight
Processed.,8,16,Darryl
You should ask him. It’s a color you would never expect. Too easy.,9,1,Jim
They're not of Cece.,7,10,Pam
Da na na na na.,5,5,Michael
"And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.",5,1,Andy
"Oh, nice!",7,5,Kevin
What? Problem solved.,7,15,Michael
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. Don't you Garbage?,4,2,Dwight
"Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is ""me."" Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!",3,23,Dwight
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.,8,13,Jim
"Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",6,9,Jim
"Yeah, you don't grab these for balance.",5,26,Pam
"Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.",1,6,Pam
Conference room. Everybody. Now!,9,14,Pam
"Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.",5,4,Michael
"Ok, I'll punch you.",2,6,Dwight
Boo!,9,9,Darryl
"The male is a funny species. We don’t just tell each other how we feel, that’s chick stuff. So instead of saying, “Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don’t want you to leave.” You say something like, “Hey, Andy, you’re making the worst mistake of your life. You’re not talented.” Well… right back at you, Darryl.",9,21,Andy
"Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.",3,21,Pam
A siesta!,5,2,Michael
"This... is the future, because... This is the past. I’ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I’ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I’ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.",8,17,Jim
"It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-",8,3,Jim
"Hey Robert, are we meeting early?",8,7,Andy
"Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.",7,2,Pam
Bye-bye. What a nice guy.,7,13,Michael
"Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.",7,12,Andy
"And if not we can just make him disappear. This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",4,5,Michael
That’s really rude. I don’t tell you hurricanes suck even though it’s true.,8,5,Dwight
Michael and Jan definitely made out.,2,8,Pam
"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",6,4,Jim
None of them. Especially not Andy.,3,13,Angela
"No, Kelly, don't.",8,7,Pam
I know. I love it there.,4,2,Jim
"You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.",5,24,Michael

"That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.",4,10,Dwight

It's really happening!,3,3,Angela
On the phone.,4,4,Michael
How about Cugino's?,3,7,Kevin
But then I moved it.Pam's,2,2,Pam
"Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?",3,1,Michael
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.,8,20,Dwight
"Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?",5,1,Darryl
"Um, hi. How are you?",1,2,Pam
"Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -",6,10,Michael
"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.",6,3,Jim
"No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.",7,13,Michael
"Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.",8,16,Dwight
What are you-- What are you doing?,5,13,Angela
"Um, I don't...",2,21,Ryan
"Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.",3,18,Michael
Thanks Angela.,3,15,Phyllis
"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.",4,1,Dwight
OK.,2,15,Michael
"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.",8,6,Dwight
I asked for a list. ...and a clown.,6,7,Darryl
Hmmm.,3,22,Michael
Manual.,6,15,Oscar
"Well, you are the one in charge of it.",9,9,Kevin
"I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.",4,4,Kevin
Good cookie.,8,10,Kevin
"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.",2,6,Michael
"What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! All right. Back to work.",9,15,Andy
"We gotta do something. This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...",3,20,Michael
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .,4,5,Ryan
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!,3,20,Andy
What are the two levels?,4,14,Jim
With sex!,4,11,Dwight
That's the Christmas spirit.,5,10,Jim
Ah! Blood everywhere.,7,3,Andy
Then what'd he do?,3,18,Angela
This is all pathetic.,8,9,Angela
"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, ""Well that's pretty premature to think,"" but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",7,23,Jim
"I don’t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.",9,22,Darryl
What power?,5,17,Jim
Why? Wha...,2,20,Michael
They are.,9,21,Pam
"Bye, Meredith. Here you go. We got you some balloons.",4,1,Angela
"Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.",3,13,Dwight
You know where it is. Lead me there.,8,11,Dwight
"So, you're okay?",3,19,Pam
"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.",7,24,Jim
Sure thing.,5,23,Dwight
It's getting bigger.,6,22,Darryl
Good. Okay.,2,21,Michael
"Let's go, come on. God!",6,5,Michael
"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",8,10,Andy
"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.",5,17,Dwight
Oh. Um. I think we're good.,3,17,Jim
"Andy’s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy’s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy’s here. Pam, he’s here.",9,1,Erin

"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?",3,8,Dwight
Missed the last part.,5,23,Jim
A paper company.,9,22,Erin
Where is Ryan?,4,14,Dwight
Hobos live in trains.,5,6,Andy
You haven't done any of the research.,8,15,Jim
"Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?",7,5,Jim
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.,8,17,Ryan
"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.",5,13,Dwight
"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your .",8,13,Andy
Really was.,6,6,Jim
Gotcha.,3,5,Ryan
Do you have a pole?,3,12,Phyllis
These are for employees only.,5,19,Angela
"Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!",8,18,Dwight

"Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!",7,12,Michael
"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.",4,1,Michael
Creed.,2,10,Oscar
"No, no never.",6,20,Pam
"Oh come on! He's right there. He was hired.  Oh check it out, ""Hired Guy.""",5,2,Kevin
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?,4,4,Jim
"I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.",6,9,Andy
Disarm!,9,8,Dwight
"Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.",7,9,Pam
"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?",1,1,Michael
"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",5,4,Michael
I think the senator is having an affair.,9,7,Angela
"I have done things like um, ""Beers in Heaven.""",4,14,Michael
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.,2,17,Pam

Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,2,19,Jim
"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.",1,1,Pam
So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?,2,9,Dwight
"Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.",5,5,Darryl
I'll kill you.,4,14,Michael
"Listen up everyone! It is 1123 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.",2,19,Dwight
Isn't that part of the fun?,4,3,Andy
"No, no no no... No, no.",5,8,Michael
"Who is ready for dinner? ""oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid"". No. I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves…  A Jamaican feast, mon!",8,16,Andy

"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.",4,9,Michael
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,4,5,Pam
"Sales is and could be very, very cool. If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.",4,13,Michael

"...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.",5,3,Michael
No... I think it's a great idea.,4,7,Jim
We are in the heart of it. And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.,5,21,Michael
What do you think is on it?,7,15,Erin
Check your hair!,8,16,Dwight
"Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?",9,4,Andy
"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",3,10,Dwight
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.,8,19,Oscar

No. What is his name?,6,7,Michael
"I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. ""That's Good morning, Vietnam!"" Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, ""Oh you're... God your butt is fat."" And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.",1,3,Michael
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.,7,3,Erin
"No, I insist. After me.Male church member I'm gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.",7,7,Michael
"What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.",9,4,Dwight
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.,8,21,Andy
"If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family.",9,19,Jim
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.,5,25,Michael
"That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...",5,11,Andy
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.,8,21,Erin
"What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.",3,22,Andy
"I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.",3,1,Michael
"He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.",3,5,Ryan
"I couldn't see your hands. Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?",4,2,Phyllis
"That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?",9,5,Dwight
"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!",3,8,Michael
Split the commission?,5,1,Phyllis

Guys.Angela &,9,22,Kevin
No.,2,5,Michael
"Well, let's keep this party movin' on.",5,2,Michael

I didn't see you! You should have yelled “Crossing!”,9,20,Pam

"Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.",5,6,Jim
"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch.

For happy hour?,6,19,Andy
"Mmm! Good pate, right? Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?",6,12,Pam
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,3,11,Pam

So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?,4,3,Phyllis
"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",6,10,Jim

I was too embarrassed!,8,10,Andy
"And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?",6,20,Erin
God. Where is Jim?,5,1,Dwight
"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.",4,7,Dwight
Who uses calling cards anymore?,2,19,Ryan
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...,1,3,Dwight

"Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.",8,4,Andy
Da na na na na!!,5,5,Michael
You deserve it.,6,24,Phyllis
Erin. Michael wants to see you.,5,24,Pam
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.,6,15,Oscar
"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",3,7,Jim
What?,3,7,Michael
Excellent! Good job.,5,1,Michael
You have your team.,8,14,Andy
"That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",2,22,Dwight
Are you kidding?,2,10,Pam
"Okay, orange slices. There ya go.",6,23,Michael
I might see a movie.,9,19,Dwight
"Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Right. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler.",1,1,Michael
It's really something.,3,3,Phyllis
"No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.",4,7,Oscar
"Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.",5,24,Jim
"I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.",8,15,Dwight
"Uh, not on a three month boat trip.",9,16,Pam
But the little cars go in the compact spot!,6,13,Dwight
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.,8,21,Pam
"Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!",7,8,Michael
"Wow, that is… wow.",9,21,Jim
Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,4,10,Pam
"I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.",3,20,Jim
"Oh, great, put her through.",2,19,Michael
Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...,6,11,Michael
"No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.",5,13,Dwight
You staying?,2,1,Ryan
"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright.",7,11,Jim
"Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...",4,5,Jim
"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",6,15,Dwight
"Last year, he walked 18 miles.",1,4,Oscar
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.,7,1,Darryl
What the hell is happening?,7,3,Angela
"I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.",3,10,Pam
Good night guys.,4,2,Michael
"Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?",8,22,Jim
"Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!",3,22,Andy
"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",7,6,Pam
Every martini has an olive.,8,10,Erin
I can always kind of win at roulette.,2,22,Jim
"Hi, Carol. How you doing?",2,22,Michael
"Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!",7,8,Dwight
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?Mrs.,8,9,Andy
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?,6,24,Michael
"You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?",2,16,Pam
Yeah.,6,6,Michael
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.,8,23,Andy
"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.",4,5,Dwight
You wanna do this?,9,23,Jim
Yeah. I'm definitely going.,2,17,Jim
"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...",4,6,Jim
Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,6,2,Michael
We have missiles too.,7,10,Oscar
I am Beyonce always.,6,23,Michael
"Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.",2,6,Michael
"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",2,8,Michael
We got it.De,7,20,Michael
"Michael, how's it going, bro?",7,9,Ryan
"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.""",6,18,Michael
"Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.",2,9,Kevin
That is hilarious.,6,7,Kevin
"Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?",2,4,Michael
"Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?",4,7,Angela
"Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.",9,16,Darryl
"It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",7,16,Michael
From when he recommended me to replace him.,7,19,Dwight
Fat Halpert. Jim Halpert.,2,1,Michael
What?!,3,7,Michael
"And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.",3,20,Dwight
Yes. They totally do.,8,10,Jim
"Wow, that sounds so... warm.",5,2,Michael
"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",6,4,Pam
"Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.",9,22,Jim
Let me get that for you.,7,24,Dwight
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.,4,5,Andy
We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.,4,3,Dwight
Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.,2,7,Pam
I'll call her back. Wish I could fire Sherri.,2,5,Michael
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.,7,12,Erin
I'm not gonna say it.,9,15,Dwight
"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",4,7,Jim
"No, I hear what you’re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?",9,11,Jim
"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",2,11,Dwight
"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?",4,7,Dwight
"David, what are you doing here?",8,24,Pam
"Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.",8,16,Jim
"Oscar, I'm ready for you.",2,8,Michael
"And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...",8,3,Pam
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.,8,3,Andy
"This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.",2,1,Michael
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.,2,1,Dwight
"for the cure... leave a message"" Ryan hangs up]",4,1,Ryan
"Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.",8,18,Erin
Saboteur!,3,3,Andy
I'm sure it's fine.,7,24,Jim
"I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.",5,18,Michael
I...,3,19,Michael
"Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -",3,21,Ryan
"Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can’t give 100% to two things at once you know.",9,21,Jim
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,2,22,Oscar
Oh.,3,6,Jim
Start over.,5,17,Darryl
"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.",2,22,Jim
"Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? And you both have such beautiful hair.",8,10,Erin
Good evening.,9,23,Dwight
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.,9,14,Erin
"Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?",3,6,Pam
Dry. Delicious.,4,2,Dwight
"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",5,11,Pam
"No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He’s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants",9,1,Angela
"I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.",2,9,Michael
"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.",2,20,Jim
Five. Five to five.,5,12,Kevin
"You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?",3,14,Michael
"When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.",2,3,Michael
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.,7,4,Angela
"It’s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I’d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.",9,22,Dwight
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!,9,11,Dwight
Oh... I'm pacing myself.,3,15,Pam
"Oh, I hit three. I hit three.",7,23,Kevin
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.,6,22,Dwight
"When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.",1,5,Michael
"All right, all right, all right.",8,8,Andy
"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?",8,18,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.",3,21,Jim
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.,6,16,Erin
"Ahem. This is for you... and ...Happy Birthday, Kel.",5,15,Jim
"Oh, hey guys.",6,19,Michael
He tore his scrotum dancing.,6,4,Pam
Much advice you seek. Do you know who that is?,2,4,Michael
"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.",3,21,Michael
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,6,23,Jim
Nosy?,7,9,Angela
"Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.",1,3,Michael
And you'll be saved.,6,5,Jim
"I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.",4,12,Jim
"One more, one more!",6,19,Phyllis
Why?,3,7,Michael
"Charles, where were you born?",5,20,Angela
"I hope he's ok, I feel bad.",5,13,Phyllis
Our office has an unusually large number of… unusually large people.,9,19,Oscar
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.,8,23,Pam
"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.",9,17,Dwight
Sorry.,5,2,Pam
"Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",6,12,Michael
"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",2,8,Jim
"And then you just changed desks, right?",2,14,Jim
"Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?",3,1,Michael
"Tuna, I’m a performer. And perform I shall.",9,21,Andy
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?,7,12,Kevin
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.,5,20,Andy
"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",5,9,Michael
"No I disagree. ""R"" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it ""murder."" And not ""muck-duck.""",6,5,Dwight
Ten minutes.,2,20,Pam
Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.,3,1,Dwight
I think I've got it.,3,21,Pam
Give me the dice!,2,22,Dwight
"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",1,5,Michael
"All right. What's the scoop, how far?",5,5,Michael
"Good, cut?",3,20,Michael
"Yeah, I think so.",9,9,Jim
"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.",7,10,Michael
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...,2,2,Phyllis
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!,7,8,Pam
"Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right!",7,13,Andy
Fire!,4,2,Kevin
I wouldn't put it past her.,4,1,Angela
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.,3,5,Ryan
You've got it.,3,8,Michael
Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it’s an idea. But what does it mean?,9,12,Dwight
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.,2,14,Jim
"Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!",3,22,Jim
What branch?,9,21,Dwight
"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",3,5,Pam
"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",7,11,Michael
"The winner under ""Special Skills,"" Mr. Don Feiner put ""Juggling.""",7,22,Darryl
"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.",3,6,Jim
"Wait! It’s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.",9,11,Oscar
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.,8,6,Andy
Is it any good?,9,16,Angela
Do I look okay?,5,15,Michael
"Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.",4,14,Kevin
"All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400.",5,10,Darryl
Hey Kevin.,3,8,Andy
"Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.",3,8,Andy
Some of these people are for real.,7,13,Dwight
"U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!",5,22,Ryan
To be Edwardian. His best work.,4,6,Oscar
It is a colonoscopy.,6,2,Michael
What are you doing? Those are my keys.,1,3,Dwight
Let's do it.,5,9,Jim
OH GOD!,2,12,Michael
Roy don't!,3,18,Pam
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.,5,6,Michael
"Oh, yeah I gave that up.",2,9,Pam
"He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-",8,24,Erin
Hooters?,3,7,Kevin
"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",7,14,Pam
I can take 3 people.,4,1,Pam
Having trouble finding a vein?,5,16,Dwight
"Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!",3,22,Andy
"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.",7,17,Michael
"Okay, that's weird. Just hitting ""door closed."" What?",7,1,Dwight
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,8,10,Andy
Stop.,6,8,Jim
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.,8,4,Darryl
Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.,6,13,Pam
"Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",5,11,Michael
"We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.",7,11,Ryan
"Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?",5,14,Jim
It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.,3,8,Dwight
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.,3,22,Andy
"Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.",5,1,Andy
"Yeah, I could read it.",5,15,Pam
"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.",5,2,Michael
Hang on.,8,10,Andy
"I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.",2,14,Michael
"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.",2,22,Dwight
Well today’s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,8,9,Dwight
Oh very.,3,8,Pam
"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.",2,1,Dwight
What is so funny?,3,21,Angela
"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",5,5,Michael
That’s enough!,9,11,Oscar
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.,3,21,Angela
Sure. That'd be fine.,5,22,Dwight
"Wait, where are the warehouse guys?",3,19,Michael
Lampshade on head! It's happening!,2,10,Michael
Jim Halpert.,1,3,Jim
Sorry.,2,8,Pam
I was... mocking.,4,3,Jim
Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?,5,1,Jim
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.,6,20,Dwight
"So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.",5,6,Jim
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...,7,4,Michael
"Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",5,9,Michael
You are lying right now.,3,12,Michael
Why not? What are you doing?,8,3,Ryan
"Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!",6,19,Dwight
It really looks great. You did a great job.,8,5,Andy
"Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!",5,22,Pam

Took him 40 minutes to get ready.,5,18,Pam
"Oop, got some blisties.",4,13,Andy
"Jan, he went running that way.",4,4,Oscar
I gotta work on this.,7,9,Ryan

What was that word they said when they showed me “Skrald mand”? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy?,9,18,Kevin
I think you mean smug,5,6,Jim
Really? Thank you. All right.,7,7,Michael
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.,2,12,Pam
"That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.",2,7,Michael
"All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",6,17,Michael
"Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.",8,21,Ryan

Business has been pretty crazy around the office.,3,2,Michael
"Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.",5,14,Michael
"Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.",6,15,Erin
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...,6,23,Oscar
"Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!",8,22,Dwight
"May he rest in pieces. You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.",3,4,Kevin
... with coffee but without the haunted.,5,25,Michael
"Funny story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says ""Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.""  And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.",2,9,Michael

"That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.",1,6,Pam
"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 730 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",6,17,Jim
"Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.",1,5,Jim
"Five o'clock. Time to go get my improv on.  Little bit of the comedy juice. Mmm. Alright, see if you can guess what this is.  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class. Just a taste of the improv.",2,9,Michael

Wow.,3,20,Jim
"Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.",2,1,Michael
"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.",2,7,Pam
"Oh, here we go.",5,16,Michael
Yo soy Cancun.,6,21,Michael
"Dude, you gotta believe.",4,3,Kevin
"Andy, I can't hear this right now.",4,5,Dwight
"Uh, Oh.",9,9,Dwight
"Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem.",2,3,Michael
"Okay, you could just show up late though.",8,22,Jim
Who was driving?,4,1,Jim
"No, I did not. Was that any good?",5,2,Andy
I wanted a cookie.,5,25,Kevin
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.,6,6,Dwight
"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.",4,13,Jim
"Stop it, please.",5,14,Pam
Twenty.,6,6,Ryan
"No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. It was just Stacy.",2,19,Kevin
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!,7,20,Michael
"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim’s desk while he’s away in Philly. Finally I’ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It’s like, “Really, Jim? You don’t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.” Wow.",9,13,Dwight
"Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!",5,13,Pam
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.,9,7,Jim
"Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...",6,6,Ryan
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.,3,17,Michael
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.,7,15,Erin
"Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-",8,19,Andy
Jim has got it bad for Pam.,2,13,Kevin
Listen to me! I love you! And I don’t care that Phillip’s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!,9,22,Dwight
"Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.",4,3,Dwight
Bruuuuuuuuuce.,5,2,Michael
Have you been to the beach yet?,5,1,Oscar
Good to see you.,2,3,Michael
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.,5,2,Jim
"I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.",4,11,Ryan
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?,2,6,Jim
His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.,7,3,Dwight
Ribbit!,7,5,Andy
Here we go.,4,3,Michael
"When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.",3,19,Andy
Can someone please help me?,9,16,Oscar
"Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?",7,6,Angela
"This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there’s a problem it’s clearly on your end. And—oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um… what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn’t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should’ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!",9,21,Angela
"Okay, let's do it.",2,22,Phyllis
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.,8,5,Andy
"You want to talk to me, come to my desk.",6,20,Erin
Hi. This is Alex.,8,18,Darryl
We should get him a bus ticket. To make his trip easier.,3,10,Pam
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,6,10,Pam
"Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don’t we move the copier into the annex like we’ve always wanted to?",9,11,Oscar
That's preposterous.,5,13,Dwight
"Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.",6,18,Phyllis
Augh.,7,24,Andy
"Well, what does Roy think about everything?",2,21,Jim
"No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?",5,1,Michael
Did it affect you outside of the office?,8,21,Erin
OK. Yeah.,1,1,Pam
I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.,7,14,Michael
So bad!,5,7,Andy
"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",1,4,Michael
We'll have to talk about this.,5,23,Ryan
"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",2,5,Michael
"Hey, Rockefeller Center!",6,12,Oscar
You sound pretty defensive Michael.,3,1,Oscar
Who?HCT Member #3 It’s Mr. Andy Bernard!,9,5,Darryl
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?,5,8,Michael
"Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?",9,7,Erin
"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.",2,10,Jim
"It looks like a It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!",7,21,Michael
so it just goes on under here like this?,8,22,Andy
"Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!",2,1,Michael
"Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.",5,2,Michael
"I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York. But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.",4,3,Kevin
"You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.",1,3,Michael
"Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?",9,3,Andy
"If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.",2,13,Dwight
"Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.",2,5,Michael
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.,6,18,Phyllis
"Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",6,16,Michael
I... I don't think I can do that.,7,24,Erin
"Down... there. Is ""jlp"" a word?",7,13,Erin
"And - Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.",6,14,Michael
"Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. Oh, not cool!",8,15,Ryan
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,6,11,Dwight
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.,3,22,Pam
"Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.",6,19,Michael
"Thanks, Pam.",3,23,Jim
Or the me that stinks.,7,5,Kevin
"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.",7,15,Michael
"Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.",8,11,Dwight
I need you to hose my aunt.,9,16,Dwight
I have an old barn!,6,15,Dwight
"No, don’t say it. You’re fired! You’re both fired!",9,23,Dwight
"Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey.  Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.",9,19,Angela
Did you sleep in cabins?,4,7,Pam
This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.,9,6,Dwight
Four months.,7,17,Jim
"I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.",3,10,Angela
"What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...",3,20,Andy
Mmhmm!,7,4,Michael
You have your lawyer there?,2,3,Dwight
No one should be planking at all.,8,1,Jim
"Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?",3,12,Jim
"Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.",3,17,Jim
"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",4,10,Michael
What's on your suit?,3,5,Phyllis
"That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission.  Hey, are you hungry?",2,7,Jim
Perhaps.,7,17,Dwight
Wow.,3,7,Jim
How about the anchor?,2,11,Pam
"No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.",3,18,Michael
I think I got it right here.,9,4,Jim
"It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.",3,23,Dwight
Just tell me.,9,2,Pam
It's going well.,5,1,Phyllis
OK.,4,1,Michael
"Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.",7,1,Oscar
If the shoe fits.,9,15,Andy
"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.",4,5,Michael
I know how it happened.,6,11,Dwight
New pants?,1,5,Pam
Ok.,7,2,Michael
"Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...",3,16,Oscar
Oh really?,5,4,Michael
"Yes, for dramatic affect.",3,22,Michael
"Hold still, woman!",3,16,Dwight
Corporate greed?,5,23,Pam
"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",2,3,Michael
"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.",7,16,Michael
Don't set it to yourself!,5,26,Dwight
"Wait, sales—what sales meeting?",9,1,Dwight
I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.,5,2,Phyllis
"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...",9,15,Andy
"In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin!",6,12,Phyllis
Next suggestion.,2,8,Dwight
"Andy, where are you?",8,19,Jim
"Listen up kid.  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.",4,3,Dwight
"I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?",9,5,Andy
"Awwhh, wow.De",7,21,Andy
"Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, ""Congratulations.""",3,4,Pam
"No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!",8,22,Andy
"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.",2,15,Michael
What's up spinsters?,3,14,Michael
Yeah...,4,14,Michael
Thank you. Thank you. No.,5,5,Darryl
"Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.",6,7,Michael
"Please, don't.",2,19,Dwight
Come up with a statement in the next hour....,8,14,Dwight
Never trust a cookie with a woman’s name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They’ll just break your heart.,8,8,Kevin
"Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.",7,7,Erin
I saw you program it in.,2,4,Michael
"This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! I dare you to produce one credible source about this.",9,6,Dwight
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.,5,11,Jim
This is impressive.,7,1,Jim
"The city mirrors, or the...?",4,3,Pam
"All right, who's ready for the next presentation?",8,15,Dwight
"Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.",5,1,Michael
"How long is this?  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.",2,7,Jim
"Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?",6,12,Jim
Nashua got mp3 players.,7,11,Pam
"Woah, I love her. How much for that?",7,18,Kevin
I tried. He will not listen.,8,18,Jim
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.,5,1,Michael
"Uh, duh.",2,8,Dwight
Just wear one of your bowties.,8,2,Phyllis
"This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.",6,9,Oscar
"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.",6,21,Michael
How do I apply?,6,21,Dwight
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?,5,25,Michael
"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",6,17,Dwight
"So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view.",8,4,Jim
"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.",3,7,Dwight
"Ehh... well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?",5,19,Andy
"Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!",2,3,Jim
Ingredients.,8,15,Dwight
What's that?,4,9,Jim
"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...",3,3,Jim
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,2,10,Dwight
"Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.

"Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.",1,4,Jim
Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.,7,8,Pam
... he cried at the end of it. He did.,2,6,Michael
"Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign.",6,9,Kevin
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.,8,20,Dwight

"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",5,17,Michael
And it was open. And people saw this. And they’re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.,8,1,Andy

We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought.

""Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."" Here's the problem.

"""I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period."" Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",2,8,Michael

"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?",4,4,Michael
I just don't want you to.,6,2,Michael

Truce?,5,9,Jim
"So, Stanley, are you really outta here?",4,6,Andy
"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.",8,7,Jim
You're not making any sense.,5,11,Andy
"Do it! It's a--- Call her!  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. Andy, don't call her!",5,7,Oscar

"Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?",6,4,Dwight
"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.",5,25,Pam
"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...",2,17,Jim
"Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.",8,19,Andy
When have you ever done that?,1,3,Michael
"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",6,24,Pam
"Hey, did you SMS text message me?",7,1,Dwight
The tea in Nepal is very hot.,9,22,Erin
"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?",7,11,Jim

Who else we got?,7,5,Jim
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.,8,10,Dwight
You didn't have to...,2,3,Dwight
"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?",6,24,Andy
"I appreciate that, thank you.",2,8,Michael

"Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.",7,13,Jim
"Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.",9,9,Dwight
"Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.",4,9,Michael
"Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.",3,23,Oscar
"I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house. Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few. Very soothing.  Want to try?",2,12,Michael
"I don't get that, I don't understand that.",4,3,Dwight
"Okay, all right, whatever.",2,22,Michael
"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",6,3,Michael
"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...",8,21,Jim
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes.,7,17,Kevin
You don't keep a diary.,5,17,Dwight

We can stay a little longer.,5,16,Oscar
"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.",8,14,Andy
"What line of work you in, Bob?",2,10,Ryan
Even without an audience you’re still at it.,8,8,Andy
"Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.",3,18,Jim
"No. Bob, no. No!",5,16,Jim
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.,7,2,Oscar
Tacos.,8,22,Darryl
"That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!",8,4,Dwight
"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.",8,6,Dwight
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.,9,18,Kevin

"I... Okay, okay, okay, alright, thank you.",5,12,Michael
Nice to meet you.,7,5,Michael
"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",7,11,Pam
"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...",8,14,Kevin
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.,1,1,Michael
I... just... if they speak Spanish.,4,11,Jim
It didn't come up organically.,7,4,Michael
"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.",8,20,Jim
This is what you did last night?,5,18,Pam
"Ah, so when did you set up shop?",5,12,Michael
"No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.",1,5,Michael
I didn't say anything.,9,14,Darryl
"So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book.",9,23,Ryan
"Hey, Jim.",5,22,Andy
"Ryan, hand the phone over.",5,24,Phyllis
Oh. That must be nice.,8,20,Erin
"Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.",3,18,Michael
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.,7,18,Pam
"Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.",6,16,Michael
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.,1,2,Ryan
"Creed, I'm all done. My turn.",9,10,Pam
"Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.",7,21,Michael
"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy.",5,24,Michael
"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.",2,19,Michael
"Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.",6,20,Dwight
Yes. I would welcome it.,7,7,Dwight
I don't think it does that.,8,19,Andy
"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",3,5,Dwight
"Oh! Ha, haha.",2,12,Pam
"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",6,12,Jim
No!,4,12,Michael
Sound good. Sounds fun.,3,23,Michael
"Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.",7,20,Erin
No. I cannot promise you that.,1,6,Michael
Will you marry me?,7,18,Angela
"Well, I find it beautiful.",3,6,Michael
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.,2,3,Jim
There's no downsizing.,1,4,Michael

No he hasn’t.,8,2,Pam
"Yeah, I do. I have that.",8,22,Andy
"Angela, Blake’s also a guy’s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?",9,7,Oscar
"Car starting.  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.",2,17,Michael
"Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.",6,19,Michael
"That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.",3,20,Andy
Are you serious? Pam.,6,16,Jim
"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work.",8,6,Dwight
No.,6,4,Michael
"So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.",8,16,Jim
"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.",5,12,Dwight
"Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.",8,3,Andy
"Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.",3,13,Pam
"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...",3,8,Michael
You're gonna get us a copier then?,5,9,Oscar

What do you know about boobs?,7,10,Jim
"Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?",6,7,Michael
Are you serious? You're earning this?,3,18,Darryl
"Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?",9,16,Kevin
She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.,6,4,Michael
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.,5,11,Dwight
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.,5,6,Dwight
"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",7,16,Michael
"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",5,9,Pam
"Ah, I'm not interested.",9,14,Dwight

What did you do to yourself?,6,23,Angela
His hair's flipping out on the sides.,3,8,Angela
Everybody! Hang on!,9,4,Dwight
"You could all be doing this, just saying.",9,16,Oscar
"They're for her to look at, Michael.",5,16,Jim
I can do this.,5,15,Michael
"Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!",3,18,Michael
What about Ryan?,5,24,Pam
Okay.,5,20,Michael
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.,8,1,Andy

"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.",8,8,Pam
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.,6,5,Andy
"The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.",9,9,Pam
What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,2,11,Dwight

"Toby, come on.",6,23,Dwight
"Oh, damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes.",5,16,Pam
Try me.,5,17,Dwight
"Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.",5,7,Dwight
"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?",6,18,Dwight
Why would anyone frame you for that?,7,11,Andy
"Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...",6,17,Michael
"I'ma call Roy, man.",3,18,Darryl
And?,3,2,Michael
"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?",7,1,Oscar

"Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.",3,20,Jim
"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",3,5,Dwight
Maybe it should come from a man.,6,19,Pam
"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.",8,24,Andy

"My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents.

"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.

"Good luck, you guys!",3,23,Oscar
"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.",6,24,Michael
"It’s a colloquial way of saying “you’re fired,” Kevin, which you are.",9,23,Dwight
Yeah. I'm going in.,3,21,Kevin
"Huh! Thanks, downer.",1,4,Michael
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.,2,19,Michael

"Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.",5,19,Michael
This is it. What do you think?,7,19,Michael
"I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.",3,8,Andy
"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.",5,9,Pam
"I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-",9,6,Oscar
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.,2,13,Michael

That's rule #1.,5,25,Erin
You're waterboarding me!,9,10,Oscar
"Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?",1,3,Dwight
Here she comes. All cleaned? Great.,2,14,Michael

"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.",4,7,Michael
OK. All right.,8,18,Jim
"I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?",3,21,Phyllis

Six. You?,6,3,Jim
"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.",9,1,Andy

"It was a good idea, though.",7,6,Michael
"We're never going to find those leads, are we?",6,18,Michael

"Yeah, OK.",6,9,Andy
I bet it’s Katie Couric. I’ve been saying this for years.,9,19,Erin
"I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.",7,4,Dwight
Wow.,6,8,Jim
"How do you spell ""animalian""?",2,16,Dwight
Ugh!,9,11,Angela
"Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can’t just press a magic button.",8,2,Phyllis
"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.",7,7,Michael
I'll take that as a no.,7,11,Dwight
You mean your thoughts and feelings?,2,21,Jim
"Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up.",3,8,Michael
"Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. He's seriously juvenile.",9,6,Erin
"Right. Of course. ""The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert."" Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.",7,11,Jim
"You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--",8,22,Andy

You got a second?,5,9,Pam
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.,2,3,Pam
"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",2,6,Jim

You are very welcome.,6,8,Andy
"Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?",2,5,Dwight
"Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.",5,1,Michael
"Maybe sometimes. But not like “hate” hate. More just like, “Mom, I hate you!” And then she would say “go to your room, young lady.” And I’d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we’d just have dinner together. But I don’t know. I’d have to meet her. Thanks.",9,23,Erin
I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. Girl in 2nd club That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do?,4,11,Michael
"I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!",8,4,Pam
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they’ve ever been to me. What I wouldn’t give for one of Phyllis’ classic room clearing farts right now.,8,9,Andy
"Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.",5,19,Pam
Can you help me?,9,8,Phyllis
What is this meeting about?,7,21,Michael
"Okay, okay. Um...",3,7,Michael
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.,4,9,Angela
Give me the phone.,2,14,Michael
"Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I’ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.",9,21,Andy
"Oh, that hurts.",1,5,Michael
"Ok, Pam, thanks.",2,12,Dwight
"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.",6,10,Michael
"No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N.",4,3,Andy
Three kitchens?,3,5,Pam
"No, that can't be right.",3,4,Michael
"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.",3,11,Michael
"Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",5,24,Michael
"The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles? The big round things.",4,3,Michael
Okay. There! No more conflict. I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. All right... is that it?,2,21,Michael
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?,8,21,Pam
Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight.,2,20,Pam
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.,4,9,Dwight
"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.",2,9,Dwight
"He didn't mention me, did he?",4,14,Jim
"I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- ooh, hold on a second. Oh.",8,24,Darryl
Alleged contract.,6,23,Dwight

He sure left in a hurry.,2,20,Dwight
Here you go.,8,5,Erin
They have fast food in Philly.,9,12,Darryl
Let's go driver! Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...,9,4,Jim
Yup.,3,6,Jim
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.,4,8,Ryan
"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...",2,15,Michael
"Oh, I just need your signature on this.",9,6,Erin
Pizza by Alfredo.,4,3,Michael
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,6,11,Michael

"Oh, so glad I could help.",5,10,Dwight
Guys.,9,22,Kevin
"You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?",3,22,Jim
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,4,2,Dwight
Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!,6,15,Andy
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.,8,20,Jim
"Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.",8,20,Erin
I do okay.,2,18,Michael
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.,3,21,Angela
"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?",8,21,Andy

"No, no, no, you have to do it-",5,15,Pam
Big mistake.,9,10,Kevin
"Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.",8,4,Andy
Road trip! Right?,5,5,Michael
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?,7,10,Oscar
"Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.",1,4,Jim
"Oh boy. Oh no, I’m not laughing at you. I’m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.",8,17,Pam
All right. I get it.,9,21,Andy
"Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-",5,18,Pam
See you then.,6,8,Pam
"Yeah, no , Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?",8,17,Ryan
"And that Angela's a midget, and that your chin is too big.",4,12,Michael
"pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore. Camera",9,23,Dwight
"Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.",1,3,Dwight
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.,2,6,Dwight
"Come down, okay?",3,19,Darryl

"You’re not serious, are you? You didn’t get any of the recital?",9,12,Jim

Already sent it to you my friend.,3,11,Kevin
"Block, block, block!",1,5,Darryl
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!,7,8,Kevin
He's just mad that we're all having fun.,9,4,Jim
"Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.",8,3,Kevin
"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",7,14,Jim
Four hundred and ninety-four months?,7,17,Jim
"You're right, I didn't even think of him.",2,5,Michael
"Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...",3,17,Michael
Here we are.,7,10,Michael
Here you go. All done.,2,3,Jim
"I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?",3,6,Pam
"Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.",9,18,Angela
"People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.",9,3,Dwight
"What? No, no, it's not a vote.",7,24,Jim
I'm done!,4,4,Oscar
"Yeah, I think this day could get worse.",9,6,Kevin
Maybe forever. Anyhow—,9,22,Darryl
"Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.",2,3,Michael
You feel connected to this?,5,3,Darryl
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he’s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.,9,22,Dwight
Fresh hot ink.,5,24,Dwight
You won't see-,8,13,Angela
I'm on it!,3,19,Dwight
"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.",7,23,Jim
"Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.",6,15,Ryan
"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?Hayworth's waiter Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.",6,20,Michael

"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",3,8,Michael
I’d like to give you $100 million.,9,13,Dwight
"OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later.  That was a good story.",5,3,Jim
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,2,12,Jim
"Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!",8,5,Andy
"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",4,13,Michael
Andy... is having a real rough day today.,3,20,Jim
"Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.",8,21,Ryan
Okay.,7,21,Michael
It's getting late.,4,9,Jim
Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.,3,11,Jim

"All right, I'll be right back.",3,4,Michael
"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",4,7,Jim
"Then why did you say ""Jackson Five?""",5,5,Darryl
You're weird.,2,17,Michael
"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A ""Michael-idea"" folder?",2,8,Michael
"I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.",3,1,Andy
"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over?",3,4,Michael
It’s a answer.,8,2,Kevin
"Aw, Pam, you're adorable",2,12,Dwight
"You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",5,9,Jim
"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.",3,13,Andy
Yeah. Mmmmmm.,3,4,Michael
"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves.",4,1,Michael
Four!,9,11,Kevin
"Well, the grass is always greener.",6,15,Jim
These covers are totally indestructible.,2,12,Dwight
"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.",8,3,Jim
"All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?",2,8,Michael
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. Sorry guys.,5,1,Darryl
Three months.,7,17,Jim
Gettin’ psyched up?,8,2,Jim
"Stay, stay.",5,25,Michael
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...Mr.,1,2,Michael
"Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, ""Hey cop, you like donuts?"" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. No, not that one.",5,21,Ryan
Bye.,9,16,Pam
"Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.",5,14,Jim
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.,7,11,Erin
Well that's not--,6,4,Andy
Thank you! Wish me luck!,6,16,Michael
"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",5,17,Michael
"Oh, fine.",9,11,Angela
"We’re gonna cover for you, ya know.",9,8,Phyllis
"No, you?",6,14,Erin
"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",6,5,Michael
Am I nomadic?,1,2,Dwight
"Hey, we nailed the sale!",3,12,Dwight
"Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.",9,17,Pam
What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.,4,3,Dwight
"Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.",6,2,Pam

"Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.",2,20,Dwight
"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",2,21,Michael
"We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you.",7,4,Dwight
"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",7,10,Michael
Really?,2,14,Michael
"Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.",7,9,Dwight
Dijonnaise.,5,24,Andy
"Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.",8,21,Ryan
Are you laughing at me?,5,6,Dwight
For Holly.,4,14,Michael
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,2,12,Jim
"Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",7,7,Michael
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.,8,14,Andy
Not until midnight.,6,16,Pam
"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now.",8,21,Dwight
I don't know who he is.,6,22,Pam
"It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh.",2,9,Jim
"I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally---",3,23,Pam
"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.",7,1,Jim
How what?,6,22,Pam
Ah. A ten inch black and white?,3,9,Michael
No. No. No.,5,25,Michael
You're ahead.,1,5,Angela
"What the is that? Oh, my...",7,23,Kevin
"Ah, come on!",8,4,Andy
Well are you?,7,10,Andy
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.,5,22,Jim
"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.",8,18,Andy
"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.",3,2,Michael
"Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?",4,11,Ryan
"Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.",5,15,Dwight
"Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.",3,20,Michael
Like what?,3,22,Pam
"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",4,7,Michael
And you know that I’m capable of this.,8,17,Ryan
Yeah.,5,13,Michael
"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.",8,13,Jim
I'm going.,5,19,Pam
Wow.,9,18,Jim
"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.",6,3,Pam
"I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.",2,20,Angela
"No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.",8,22,Andy
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. I hid the leads.,6,18,Erin
Can I talk to you a minute?,5,19,Andy
I don't think anyone thought that.,9,9,Pam
I’ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I’m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,9,13,Dwight
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,6,14,Michael
It’s getting tougher. I just didn’t know that it was gonna be this hard.,9,12,Pam
Watson carpet and tile.,8,16,Pam
"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?",4,2,Michael
"""Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.""",5,5,Dwight
You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!,9,16,Andy
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow!,7,4,Andy
That is me. Wish me luck.,5,6,Jim
"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",4,5,Michael
Thank.,8,2,Kevin
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!,5,19,Michael
"Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.",8,11,Kevin
Come on in. Good to see you.,4,9,Michael
I get back from work around 6.,5,17,Jim
"No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. You know I have a kid with you, right?",7,5,Pam
Seven thousand dollars.,5,15,Angela
"You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.",9,18,Pam
"""You're such a great friend.""",8,16,Darryl
No where near the big rock.,3,22,Andy
I guess I forgot.,3,19,Ryan
"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.",2,15,Darryl
"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.",3,16,Ryan
"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",8,20,Pam
I miss Stacy.,5,16,Kevin
I can see that.,5,4,Jim
"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",2,21,Jim
"Wow, that's awesome!",7,11,Kevin
"No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.",6,7,Michael
Get in quick.,7,7,Erin
"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",6,11,Andy
"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!",8,11,Dwight
"Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.",3,21,Michael
"Punishment fits the crime, I accept.",6,6,Dwight
Ahhhhhhhhh. I'm hungry.,3,3,Michael
How many fingers am I holding up?,2,1,Dwight
Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?,7,5,Andy
Hi guys.,8,24,Andy
"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.",4,7,Michael
"The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them. And old enough to know the difference between the two. I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls. But old enough to know better. I'm at a perfect age. I could die now. But I won't, because I am young.",4,2,Michael
"Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.",7,24,Erin
We're so alike. So alike.,3,6,Michael
"Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.",5,22,Michael
Take six.,1,2,Dwight
"Oh, I do!",6,15,Andy
"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.",9,16,Dwight
I don't want ketchup.,3,2,Ryan
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.,8,10,Dwight
"Okay, you know what?",4,6,Jim
"I am gonna need your advice I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?",6,6,Jim
"That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?",7,12,Ryan
Wow. I think you're bluffing.,2,22,Jim
"Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—",9,3,Darryl
"Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.",4,1,Pam
"Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.",5,20,Michael
Toby.,6,4,Dwight
That you’re learning a made-up language from HBO’s Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!,9,3,Andy
"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.",9,14,Pam
"Hello.AJ I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise.",7,11,Erin
"Not today, Kevin. Cannot be around carbs today. You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?",2,7,Michael
"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.",2,10,Michael
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.,4,11,Ryan
"Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.Mr.",6,4,Jim
"Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.",1,4,Michael
Ahem. What's up?,2,14,Michael
Thank you. It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.,6,20,Kevin
No.,2,22,Michael
"Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.",2,9,Michael
"Hey, Michael.",4,2,Pam
We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked.,5,7,Andy
I'm back together with Val. Yay...,9,10,Darryl
You'll have Pam to answer to.,6,4,Dwight
"Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .",5,12,Michael
You wanted to see me?,4,7,Dwight
Yes. God. They're awesome.,1,6,Michael
"Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.",2,7,Oscar
Will you help me?,2,10,Angela
"Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.",2,1,Michael
"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",1,5,Jim
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.,7,21,Phyllis
"My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. ... How much?",3,16,Michael
"Are you sure that's not the ""gay"" ear?",5,25,Andy
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? Just say the word 'coolio'.,9,15,Andy
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.,7,18,Kevin
"I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.",1,5,Pam
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke.,1,4,Jim
No.,5,8,Michael
"And oh, Jim...",6,6,Michael
What is that in your ear? A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.,3,5,Dwight
"Morning, Pam. Hey.",2,7,Michael
"No, we used to. Now we're friends.",3,2,Jim
Any questions?,3,22,Michael
I'm in the bathroom.,8,19,Erin
"No, no, turn it around.",2,10,Michael
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,7,22,Jim
"All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.",3,3,Michael
"Oh, God! Oh. Wow.",3,6,Michael
"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",2,21,Michael
"Well, it's... No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.",3,23,Michael
And I was still just a paper salesman.,8,19,Jim
"Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.",3,11,Pam
"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",2,21,Michael
"Oh my gosh, please, don't.",9,18,Pam
"Oh, thanks!",2,21,Pam
"Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",5,13,Michael
"Okay, Toby, I gotta go.",5,1,Oscar
"Nope, not doing that.",7,5,Jim
We didn't get it.,7,11,Michael
"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.",5,15,Pam
"Maybe it's just more like, ""be mine.""",7,15,Andy
Define scorched earth policy.,3,23,Dwight
"Ha ha! Yeah, joke’s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!",9,12,Dwight
"Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.",4,4,Oscar
T.,6,1,Kevin
Then I will.,7,4,Dwight
"I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --",5,16,Michael
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.,9,16,Angela
Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!,6,1,Dwight
"On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",2,21,Michael
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.,5,7,Ryan
"I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.",5,5,Michael
"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...",4,1,Jim
He never called a meeting.,7,24,Jim
How?,7,4,Michael
"Here... Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard!",7,20,Michael
"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.",4,8,Michael
"Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",6,5,Michael
"Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...",6,11,Erin
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?,2,22,Dwight
It feels amazing!,7,4,Kevin
I think I know where he is.,7,11,Michael
"Oh God, what was that?",5,12,Michael
.... Corner idea?,5,21,Pam
You have to tell me now.,3,5,Pam
I have to go clean up after the party.,4,3,Angela
Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.,6,4,Dwight
"Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.",3,12,Dwight
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.,5,22,Michael
"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off? How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",4,1,Michael
"Hey, Halpert, what’s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you’re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?",9,12,Dwight
Ok.,2,7,Michael
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-,4,13,Jim
"Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.  She's gonna love it. Right?",5,8,Jim
The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.,9,2,Erin
... Square is fine.,5,20,Pam
Not necessary.,6,8,Andy
"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?",2,11,Pam
"She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.",2,7,Oscar
All right. Thank you very much. Looking good. Who's that little fella?,9,15,Andy
"Okay. All right, Dwight. Take my money. Go ahead. Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction. The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends. Just ring me up. Go ahead .",4,10,Michael
I gave it to you in the car.,2,4,Michael
"What's up, Meredith?",5,1,Jim
"Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.",2,10,Dwight
"DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!De",7,20,Michael
"I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.",9,16,Phyllis
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?,8,4,Angela
"All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, ""I read a book about anthropology.""",6,23,Ryan
Which one is it?,8,11,Dwight
"Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.",7,1,Dwight
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James.,7,24,Ryan
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,2,20,Dwight
"I, really don't like spending time with him.",7,20,Erin
"No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.",6,16,Michael
500 and one penny. One million dollar!,5,4,Michael
"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.",4,8,Michael
Hour forty-five.,7,3,Andy
Don't make me do this the hard way.,2,20,Dwight
"Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..",9,10,Oscar
"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.",7,23,Andy
You won't be disappointed.,3,8,Pam
"Oh, already.",5,16,Michael
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.,2,15,Michael
OK!Walt Jr. Hey bro! It was here all along.,9,6,Erin
"""Uh, can you get this rundown for me?""",5,21,Jim
Right. My mom-,8,3,Kevin
Let the bedbugs bite!,8,16,Dwight
"Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.",4,1,Michael
"Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.",6,23,Michael
"Ryan, just tell us your plan.",7,9,Pam
"I'm sorry, everybody.",2,10,Phyllis
"Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.",4,11,Ryan
Completely.,8,1,Phyllis
"All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that’s-- that’s decorative.",9,8,Jim
Kill me... right now.,4,11,Michael
"Here, here… Just…",8,23,Dwight
"Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.",3,15,Michael
Can I talk to you for a second?,6,1,Jim
"I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.",2,8,Michael
Would that make you happy?,2,4,Dwight
Gross.,4,1,Jim
"No! Pam, I'm over here!",4,14,Dwight
"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.",1,2,Kevin
"Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh",5,21,Dwight
"Yes, you have very nice teeth.",2,6,Pam
And person.,5,15,Angela
This one's for all you ladies out there.,9,10,Pam
"Okay. That sounds good.  Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.",3,5,Michael
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. Oh! Thank you.,2,1,Michael
"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...",2,22,Jim
"Oh, shiii...",3,15,Michael
That is not the expression.,1,2,Jim
What did you---,3,3,Dwight
"I get paid $40,000 per year.",7,2,Pam
What's that?,5,6,Jim
"Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",6,15,Andy
You know who that is?,7,21,Michael
"Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...",3,11,Phyllis
I’ll introduce you.,8,2,Darryl
Thank you. Sharing...Mr.,1,2,Michael
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.,9,4,Pam
I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,5,24,Michael
I find you absolutely ribbiting!,7,5,Darryl
Please take an agenda item.,9,22,Dwight
It can’t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.,9,12,Dwight
Vietnam sounds.,2,12,Dwight
Yep. This is Erin.,8,20,Andy
"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.",8,21,Pam
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.,9,16,Dwight
"Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.",7,11,Pam
Now that sounds serious.,3,21,Jim
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.,9,23,Jim
"Really, where?",5,1,Pam
"Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.",8,23,Jim
"Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, ""Tracks of my Tears""?",8,22,Ryan
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,2,15,Darryl
So what's in the box?,3,15,Jim
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,6,22,Michael
"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.",3,8,Michael
What? What?,2,5,Michael
Gotcha. Alright.,3,17,Jim
"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",7,10,Michael
"Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.",3,19,Jim
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.,8,3,Andy
"Hey, you don't deserve her.",5,16,Michael
I swear...,8,10,Andy
I'm going into labor.,8,8,Pam
"Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.",6,16,Jim
Question? May I investigate?,2,13,Dwight
"What are you doing? What, stop...",2,12,Jim
"Uh, nice party Michael.",1,4,Oscar
I'm sorry. What now?,4,9,Michael
"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!",4,13,Pam
Yes. Put the DVD in.,6,7,Phyllis
Stacy.,2,6,Kevin
"Thank you, Esther.",9,22,Dwight
"Ooh, she's counting again.",8,21,Andy
"Yeah, people like me I guess.",4,7,Jim
Nicely done!,8,11,Kevin
I'm Andy.,5,9,Andy
"Nah, you definitely weren’t kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.",8,2,Jim
"Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.",8,4,Andy
"Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills, sub-par.",5,5,Andy
"This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.",2,16,Michael
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?,4,5,Andy
"Yeah, trust me.",9,16,Dwight
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.,5,9,Oscar
"Thank you, Jim.",9,21,Dwight
"Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.",3,5,Pam
"You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.",8,21,Ryan
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?,8,10,Dwight

"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",6,11,Jim
"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",5,13,Dwight
"No, I don't think so.",3,20,Jim
"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?",8,1,Jim
"You put the TV here, you put the family over here.",7,4,Michael
Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm?  We should check the security tapes Toby.,6,2,Dwight
"Oh, no thank you.",6,8,Pam
Unforgivable.,2,4,Jim
"Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.",3,19,Andy
"Oh, my God! Go, go!",7,3,Pam
Yesh.,3,2,Michael
"Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That’s why I’m doing it.",9,12,Darryl
Where'd you get that kind of money?,5,15,Oscar
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.,9,16,Andy
"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.",4,1,Michael
"That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.",6,18,Darryl
I’m an oncologist and you are a dog.,9,5,Pam
"Yeah, he's definitely something.",4,2,Jim
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.,8,6,Andy
You know that I was doin' this.,5,22,Jim
We're not doing this today.,4,2,Ryan
"To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.",6,11,Angela
"It's broken right, he can't...",2,12,Jim
"Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need ""small talk."" What topics can you use for small talk?",6,5,Michael
Excellent!,3,22,Michael
What?,6,8,Michael
What is she so upset about?,2,10,Michael
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,2,10,Michael
"Love you, mom.",6,16,Pam
Wait! I wanted to sit next to you.,4,6,Dwight
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,8,8,Dwight
You're in my way!,8,12,Angela

"Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence, that's... Mary-",2,9,Michael
Do you have any pastries without fruit?,6,18,Angela
Hey! Where did you go?,7,12,Andy
You play?,7,8,Jim
Do you think they'll get the account. How come you never answer me?,2,7,Phyllis
And come and tell me. Doesn’t matter what it is.,8,7,Andy
"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.",2,11,Pam
"Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...",3,5,Michael
"Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!",4,12,Michael

Yeah I couldn't cut it down.,7,17,Jim
See that factory?,3,2,Michael
Mobsters are!,6,5,Andy
"Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.",8,20,Erin
"What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",7,17,Jim
Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.,2,7,Dwight
"What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, ""Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down."" I'm not even attracted to you.",2,1,Dwight
Fascinating.,8,21,Andy
"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!",4,14,Pam
PSST! PSST!,5,19,Michael
Those figures I gave you? They're false.,9,6,Oscar
"Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.",2,19,Michael
"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.",7,10,Pam
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?,7,5,Andy
"There is one condition, Michael.",5,6,Jim
"Yikers, lice.",9,10,Erin
And brush our teeth.,2,11,Pam
I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.Mary-,2,9,Michael
Yeah...,2,12,Michael
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...,3,23,Andy
"You got this, Roy.",9,2,Darryl
"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.",1,6,Jim
"Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.",5,6,Michael
"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.",5,9,Dwight
"Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?",8,3,Dwight
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.,5,9,Oscar
"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",2,17,Michael
Definitely.,3,11,Jim
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.,8,20,Erin
See you in a bit. Bye-bye. May I have a moment of your time please?,3,2,Michael

"No, I will not.",8,23,Pam
I feel good. Wow.,5,20,Pam
"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",2,8,Dwight
How about Darryl?,4,5,Pam
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.,3,12,Angela
That's here.,2,4,Pam
I'd like a magazine.,2,20,Kevin
"Mmhmm, China. China.",7,10,Michael
What do you want?,4,2,Angela
"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.",7,2,Dwight
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.,8,21,Andy
I'm sure it was really lovely.,5,1,Pam
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.,4,1,Michael
"No need for consternation, everything is under control.",3,18,Michael
Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.  They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.,6,8,Dwight
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?,9,11,Dwight
Let's go. I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.,6,23,Michael
"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",2,8,Michael
It is. I'm good.,5,23,Michael
"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog. One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead. Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies. Did I feel bad for killing him? No. That's how you deal with a thief.",4,1,Dwight
You don't want to recycle them?,1,6,Ryan
Why? I don't understand.,5,26,Dwight
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.,7,12,Dwight
Let's see yours.,9,14,Dwight
"I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.",3,18,Jim
"OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.",9,4,Dwight
"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",8,10,Andy
"Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.",4,13,Pam
We should go on a double date.,3,12,Jim
"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",6,4,Dwight
"Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?",7,19,Jim
Yum.,4,3,Dwight
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today .,3,20,Angela
Sometime today.,2,19,Jim
"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",6,5,Dwight
"Oh, dear.",2,21,Phyllis
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.,9,14,Darryl
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.,5,20,Andy
"Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley’s sleeping. You don’t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?",9,22,Oscar
"Wait, what girlfriend?",7,11,Dwight
"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",4,3,Michael
Shawn Marion.,8,11,Jim
"Yes, it was.",4,2,Angela
"Kevin, stay.",5,25,Michael
"We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?",6,14,Michael
"Damn it Kevin, come on.",6,12,Michael
"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",2,16,Michael
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?,7,14,Erin
"No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi.",5,2,Pam
"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.",4,11,Michael
"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!",2,6,Michael
I don't even know what to say.,2,3,Dwight
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?,6,4,Oscar
"Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line.",8,24,Erin
Practice Olympics.,7,13,Michael
How much did you give him?,7,15,Pam
You would?,7,8,Andy
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.,3,8,Andy
"Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.",8,23,Andy
"Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.",4,12,Darryl
"Uh, better ask Jim.",9,23,Dwight
I liked them.,7,2,Pam
"All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?",5,3,Angela
This is terrible.,7,18,Pam
What do you think I am saying to you?!,5,6,Dwight
"Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.",2,1,Michael
I'll take the tea pot.,2,10,Oscar
"Hello, Holly. Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.",4,14,Michael
Where's your place?,5,8,Phyllis
Was it your scores?,5,6,Jim
"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",6,12,Michael
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.,6,23,Andy
"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",2,3,Jim
You should move down here with me.,8,16,Erin
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!,7,20,Michael
"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?",7,22,Jim
Michael. Reading.,6,15,Oscar
"Yeah. All right. Bye. All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?",4,13,Jim
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,5,24,Michael
Threat neutralized.,1,5,Michael
I’d love to invest.,9,13,Dwight
"I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?",4,13,Phyllis
We can do...,6,16,Michael
Darn it!,4,4,Jim
"Andy, is this you?",6,12,Angela
"Okay, good then.",5,14,Jim
"Jim. Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space. Alright, let's get back to work.",2,9,Michael
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.,5,1,Oscar
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.,3,14,Pam
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...,2,1,Michael
I am trying to bring team spirit.,3,22,Dwight
Oh baby I love your way.,8,7,Darryl
"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",6,2,Pam
Try a different door.,5,13,Pam
I hope you're not recording this conversation. Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.,5,22,Michael
"Babe alert!  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.",5,16,Michael
Cryogenics. Beer me five.,5,1,Jim

"You’re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—",9,21,Jim
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.,6,4,Michael
Can you get the phone?,8,15,Andy
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.,6,4,Dwight
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.,3,7,Ryan
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. Do you like mints?,6,21,Michael
Let me ask you something.,2,8,Michael

"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",5,13,Michael
OK.,5,1,Michael
"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?",5,23,Jim
"I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",3,17,Michael
It's not what you think.,2,1,Dwight
You should get more sleep.,3,14,Pam

"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. I see steak.",3,10,Michael
"Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.",3,20,Pam
"Chicken, hot dog, burger.",2,9,Jim
"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.",8,10,Jim
"Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.",8,22,Erin
"Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.",2,2,Michael
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?,2,4,Ryan
Automatic voicemail.,2,3,Pam
Popcorn anyone?,3,3,Pam
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.,7,7,Michael
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.,3,5,Michael
I am Bill Buttlicker.,5,6,Jim
The friendships.,3,23,Jim
"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...",8,8,Dwight
I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.,8,23,Angela
"The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. ""Mental"" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.",6,5,Michael
What are you talking about?,1,3,Jim
"It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.",7,5,Oscar
Not even Harry Potter?,4,4,Jim

Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,6,21,Michael
Jelly beans.,5,17,Pam
"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",2,6,Michael
Which is you.,7,10,Jim
"I know, I know. You're right, you're right.",5,15,Michael
"Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. Hey! How are you?",9,11,Jim
"""Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth."" Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.",5,5,Dwight
You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.,2,6,Pam
"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.",7,17,Andy
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.,5,21,Pam
It was not rotting.,1,4,Jim
"Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?",6,19,Jim
"Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!",9,4,Jim
"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.",7,6,Dwight
"I can help out, if you need me.",1,5,Oscar
Got it. Go.,8,23,Dwight
Good. How are you doing?,2,13,Dwight
Oh! Hey! How'd it go?,9,4,Pam
But--,5,10,Angela
"You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?",7,5,Michael
So do I sign?,5,10,Michael
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.,4,4,Ryan
Your path from obesity begins right here!,8,9,Dwight
"Michael, why would we all go to the dump?",6,18,Phyllis
Please cut it out.,5,14,Pam
"Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.",8,15,Dwight
"Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.",4,11,Michael
"Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?",4,3,Michael
"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.",2,10,Dwight
"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.Ex-client Oh, OK.",4,2,Michael
Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.,7,5,Darryl
"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",8,7,Pam
"I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.",8,15,Dwight
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.,3,5,Dwight
Definition.,8,3,Andy
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?,3,12,Kevin
"Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.",1,6,Michael
"You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.",5,19,Michael
"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.",2,12,Pam
Can I use your phone?,3,12,Dwight
Light side.,8,10,Andy
He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,9,15,Pam
"Nope, that's okay.",3,2,Jim
"Yes, under my tutelage.",2,6,Michael
You can't even do that.,7,8,Jim
I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.,4,7,Michael
Where are the yams?,2,12,Michael
"Yeah, but I don't smoke.",8,7,Jim
"Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?",3,9,Jim
"Okay, fine. Hurry back.",3,4,Michael
Fine. Five times.,6,23,Dwight
All right...,6,5,Michael
Are you drunk?,5,7,Angela
Anything can happen at the Dundies! They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!,7,20,Michael
"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, and now I don't wanna lose the baby.",6,2,Michael
"“Robert, Hey!” Exclamation point.",8,14,Jim
What do you—Dwight!,9,22,Angela
"Who are you talking to, specifically?",4,5,Jim
Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,3,4,Pam
"Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!",3,19,Dwight
"No, Michael, no.",6,22,Pam
"I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, "" This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."" No.",5,25,Michael
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--,6,4,Michael
And did you get the tickets?,7,12,Erin
"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",8,10,Andy
"I could tell, from the body language.",1,4,Dwight
"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",6,22,Pam
"I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.",3,18,Michael
And not come through for you?,5,22,Dwight
"Andy, this is the deal we made.",7,17,Pam
"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,",2,16,Michael
Yes. Gooooo-tee!,5,1,Michael
Are you inching away from me?,5,8,Pam
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.,9,18,Dwight
"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...",9,14,Pam
"No, was it good?",7,24,Jim
This is going on the outside. The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner. Do not tape those on.,4,2,Michael
Are we ready?,2,3,Michael
Why?,5,1,Michael
"Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.",1,5,Dwight
"And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---",5,7,Michael
You've got something on your nose.,7,11,Jim
Ha ha.,9,16,Pam
"Oh, there's one mistake.",8,6,Dwight

An oven mitt? Okay.,2,10,Michael
"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. Let's go.",3,7,Michael

"Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?",8,6,Andy
"Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.",8,5,Andy
"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",6,3,Michael
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.,7,5,Jim
You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it.,6,10,Jim

"Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!",9,3,Dwight

"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.",7,11,Andy
"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.",9,20,Dwight
She's kind of a rube.,6,20,Michael
I'd rather not say.,6,6,Ryan
"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",5,17,Michael

"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,",8,10,Andy
"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",9,10,Jim
"Hey, hey, come on, language.",8,23,Jim
All right. You have to pick up after them.,7,11,Michael
So? I've beaten up black belts.,2,6,Michael

"No, this is horrifying.",7,23,Andy
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?,1,6,Michael
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.,6,18,Jim
"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.",8,7,Pam
It's fine.,3,20,Jim
"Okay, well you have to show us.",9,7,Pam
"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free.

"So, let us consider this matter ended.",3,20,Michael
"To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. Makes me rethink having skin at all.",2,19,Dwight

It's ok.,2,9,Angela
She's not gonna... Just...,6,16,Pam
Hey guys.,4,4,Michael
On an innocent baby.,9,22,Dwight
"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.",5,5,Pam
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.,7,21,Jim

"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",6,4,Michael
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?,7,6,Jim

Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt.,2,10,Michael

"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?",2,7,Michael
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.,3,13,Andy
"Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.",3,12,Michael
"Yes, she is nuts.",4,2,Michael
"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",1,3,Jim
"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.",4,3,Andy
Everything. She's perfect.,5,1,Ryan
"Yeah, uh, well.",3,5,Jim
Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?,7,7,Michael

Who was the second man on the moon?,3,23,Dwight
Fine. Get outta here.,4,9,Dwight
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?,8,7,Darryl

And their king bee.,2,9,Dwight
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...,4,12,Pam
I'm amazing.,8,19,Pam
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.,5,1,Michael
"I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...",5,1,Michael
You are disgusting.,3,4,Michael
"I really doubt it, Michael.",3,22,Pam
I've said too much.,5,22,Dwight
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.,5,7,Michael
"Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... that maybe you should...",3,18,Michael
Are you saying-,6,5,Andy
"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",5,13,Pam
"Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.",5,22,Michael
Ten.,6,6,Dwight

Michael! Michael.  Michael ...,3,4,Dwight
Coolio.,9,15,Dwight
Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?,6,2,Dwight
Oh wow. So that’s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.,8,8,Jim
"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",2,10,Jim
Move to the side of the road!,9,22,Dwight
"Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.",2,7,Jim
"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...",8,10,Jim
No one's calling.,1,4,Pam
"Um, question Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...",1,6,Michael
"Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever.",3,14,Pam
It’s a thing. It means “you only live once”.,9,11,Oscar
A little frazzled.,6,16,Andy
Wired.,1,1,Pam
Can I inspire? I don’t know!.....I don’t know.,8,2,Andy
"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. Michael Winslow, anyone?",2,17,Michael
Relax?!,6,20,Pam
Okay. Talk to you Monday.,2,22,Michael
This is stupid.,4,2,Phyllis

Sold! To Jim.,5,4,Darryl
Not bad.,2,21,Jim
"You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say It's showtime. Get out there. De",7,20,Michael
So we know which truck to van...,9,14,Dwight
"We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.",8,18,Pam
"It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.",5,6,Jim
"You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.",8,22,Andy
"Dwight, it’s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.",9,8,Angela
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.,6,14,Michael
"Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?",6,4,Michael
Everybody shut up and work!,9,11,Oscar
I'm not.,3,8,Jim
"Dwight, can you get those please?",5,7,Michael
Lousy Picture.,6,4,Jim
"Jim, Michael's office.",4,7,Dwight
"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.",2,8,Michael
This isn’t gonna work out.,9,13,Dwight
What? You making bread?,9,14,Darryl
That’s great. Let’s do this guys.,8,1,Dwight
"Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.",2,18,Michael
You'll break it.,2,10,Michael
"Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?",5,26,Michael
Yeah it's a TV show...,7,8,Erin
And the fear.,9,9,Pam
"Hey, Andy. How are you, man?",3,19,Jim
No way!Walt Jr. Way!,9,6,Andy
Well you're gonna have to.,6,5,Andy

"I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.",9,16,Jim
"You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.",7,4,Michael
"The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.",6,4,Kevin
Alright.,2,17,Jim
"I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.",7,21,Erin
You've been watering down the soap?,7,10,Pam
A formal warning...,4,12,Jim

"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",6,21,Michael
"Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. ""Schrute Space,"" very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. ""Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,"" it's good.",1,3,Jim

"Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about.",5,24,Phyllis
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,2,15,Michael
Your brothers took you out drinking?,6,4,Pam
"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.",5,18,Dwight
"Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.",5,1,Michael
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.,6,7,Michael
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.,8,10,Andy

"Hello, I'm looking for a room.",4,4,Pam
"I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",8,13,Jim
"I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.",6,7,Michael
"Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.",9,3,Darryl
Maybe Stanford would be cool.,2,21,Jim
He gives the best back rubs in the office.,4,5,Michael
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.,3,21,Pam
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.,6,11,Erin
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?,6,23,Angela
Not Night at the Roxbury.,9,16,Jim
Why don't you go Michael?,3,22,Kevin
Yep.,4,3,Jim
Ohh...,4,14,Pam
Your arm feels good on my back.,8,8,Kevin
"I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?",2,5,Michael
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!,2,2,Michael
Okay. Good luck. You're gonna be great.,9,9,Pam

"Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?",9,17,Pam
"Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.",8,8,Phyllis
Is that good?,7,19,Michael
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.,2,15,Dwight
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.,8,1,Kevin
"Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.",8,2,Andy
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?,6,7,Jim
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.,7,11,Andy
Yes. Absolutely. Right away.,7,2,Pam
"No, but we should discuss that another time.",3,3,Dwight
I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.,3,4,Dwight

The Electric City. Scranton.,3,8,Michael
"Well, okay. Different management styles.",2,14,Michael
"It is moving day. I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um ssp... No, I did not kill her. We were just at different places in our lives. No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo. She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale. Fresh outlook, and it's all good.",4,10,Michael
"Okay, it’s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",8,1,Jim
What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?,7,8,Michael
"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.",2,7,Pam
"Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually.

I'm leaving for the day at four.",7,21,Michael
Fireball!,9,21,Jim
"I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.",7,15,Angela
"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",8,7,Pam
"Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.",2,6,Dwight
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,8,7,Dwight
Sign this.,6,3,Dwight
You occupied the America room for six weeks. That's our most popular room.,4,10,Dwight

"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.",4,2,Michael
"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.",6,9,Jim
"What? No, it's not... it's nothing.",3,11,Pam
"Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?",5,6,Michael
"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.",7,23,Dwight
Very cute.,8,9,Jim
Jedediah.,6,16,Angela
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,6,16,Michael

The beef is poisoned?,3,8,Kevin
"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.",9,1,Pam
Master bee.,2,9,Dwight
"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",2,18,Michael
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?,8,24,Andy
Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.,4,14,Michael
"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",6,15,Dwight
"Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!",1,2,Dwight
"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",4,7,Michael

"Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman’ by Arthur Miller, it’s a great play about crushed dreams.",9,21,Andy
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,4,6,Jim
"Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.",2,8,Oscar
"Ten years ago, I didn’t care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I’m like, that poor gimp is somebody’s child.",9,7,Pam
That's not how it works.,2,20,Dwight
Hold on one second.,6,21,Jim
"Hey, buddy. Welcome back.",3,8,Ryan
Woo! Shotgun!,4,6,Michael
"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?",9,10,Pam
Look who I found!,7,8,Erin
"Listen, can I talk to you for a second?",6,19,Dwight
"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.",8,9,Andy
"Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!",3,19,Dwight
"Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.",3,14,Jim
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?,5,21,Ryan
No.,4,1,Michael
Doesn't it?,5,12,Jim
"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",8,14,Andy
And I will be taking questions.,3,5,Michael

I... That was just...,2,15,Michael
Universal donor.,6,19,Dwight
The raise isn't real.,8,19,Jim
Take it easy.,5,24,Jim
These are gross.,9,15,Pam
I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.,5,22,Michael
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,6,10,Michael
"Well, that, what's that one?",6,16,Andy
"Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  Alright, good.",6,6,Michael
What are you doing?,4,8,Jim
"Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.",7,18,Pam
I want a truce.,5,22,Dwight
It did not.,6,23,Michael
"Well, I think that the real question is Who is the whistleblower?",6,24,Kevin
Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.,5,25,Michael
Pamela Beesly Halpert--,6,8,Michael
Fine! It’s Oscar. So what?,9,8,Angela
"Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.",7,21,Jim
It’s true.,8,17,Dwight
Hey there.,2,9,Michael
Are we ready for the game?,1,5,Michael

"Well, we’re here. Perfect.",9,8,Jim
I'm Jim Halpert.,3,20,Dwight
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?,4,14,Jim
"Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my ""Lost"" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?",3,13,Andy
"Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.",3,7,Phyllis
It is. Big time.,6,17,Jim
"I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.",7,20,Andy
"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",6,22,Michael
"Watch the long passes, you guys!",1,5,Michael
I know. You get to pick.,7,13,Erin

How about green?,1,4,Pam
"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?",1,3,Dwight
"Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?",6,20,Ryan
That is so insulting.,5,21,Pam
Well don't look so surprised.,5,10,Dwight
That’s kind of an impossible question.,9,19,Jim
"I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?",9,16,Jim
"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.",3,11,Michael
I bet you did.,2,8,Ryan
"Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs! Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half! Here comes Stanley! Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!",3,22,Michael
"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",2,17,Michael
It's really good to see you.,3,8,Pam
That's awful.,8,10,Phyllis
See how easy that is?,4,14,Jim
What?,5,22,Michael
Second line.,8,21,Jim
"Hey, Julie! You having fun?",6,19,Michael
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --,7,22,Ryan
Where'd I find what?,3,4,Jim
"What part of ""I need to pee"" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.",7,14,Michael
"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?",4,10,Michael
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,2,21,Michael
"Right, it feels strange.",8,4,Andy
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?,2,22,Kevin
"Dwight, what are you---",3,19,Pam
"Mm-hmm, near the river.",3,18,Phyllis
"Hey, do you have a second?",3,7,Jim
"I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?",7,21,Michael
Mmm! It's after midnight. Michael and,6,4,Michael
"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.",3,15,Jim
We did it!,2,7,Michael
I should probably get back to work.,3,8,Pam
I'm gonna tell Jim to go himself.,9,9,Darryl
No I didn’t want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it’s weird that she’s not calling.,8,5,Andy
Come on.,7,23,Dwight
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.,5,14,Michael
"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.",9,15,Andy
Your wish is my command.,5,1,Andy

"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",7,11,Michael
We did it!Michael and,3,7,Dwight

Will never be her name.,5,11,Dwight
"Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. Look, it's official!",5,20,Pam
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.,3,13,Dwight
"Thanks, Kevin. Um...",4,14,Michael
"Oh, Andy.",8,24,Pam
I have to do something to his eyes.,4,6,Dwight
All right. I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,3,8,Jim
"No, Dwight. You’ll be doing the whacking.",9,23,Jim
How are you guys doing? Need anything?,3,23,Michael

"No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.",5,24,Dwight
"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.",4,12,Jim
"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",2,8,Pam
I can't-,2,9,Dwight
"Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in?",8,3,Andy
We're circling it.,5,26,Michael
"Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",2,8,Jim
That's cool.,1,6,Jim
"That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.",4,12,Darryl
"Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.",3,10,Angela

Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!,8,14,Angela
Yes.,7,18,Michael
"Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.",2,1,Michael
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.,7,10,Kevin

You? A bottle capper?!,3,2,Dwight
"So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.",6,4,Dwight

"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",3,1,Michael
"Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.",5,24,Andy
Can I change rooms?,3,23,Jim
"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",5,13,Pam
"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.",2,3,Jim
"Robert, is Nellie our new manager?",8,19,Pam
"I just gonna- quick- Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Guys, I got my old job back!",8,24,Andy
"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.",4,10,Kevin
"There’s no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.",9,8,Dwight
"Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?",2,17,Dwight
Alright. Movin' on.,2,12,Michael
You have information about the sex predator?,3,21,Dwight
I don't want to go.,7,11,Jim

"Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.",5,13,Michael
You shot Dwight?,4,1,Phyllis

"Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...",3,10,Michael
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.,3,12,Phyllis
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?,2,5,Michael
"Oh, our contract.",7,9,Dwight
"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?",5,18,Michael
"Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.",3,23,Oscar
This is where we first kissed.,7,18,Michael
That's a good deal.,4,1,Michael
"Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.Bob's",8,9,Jim
"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.",8,14,Andy

Okay.,6,22,Michael
"Uh, MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.",3,18,Michael
"Don’t! oh, you must think…I’m not. I’m using the fax, this isn’t, no wait. I’m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There’s usually an Erin here.",8,2,Kevin
So who will be your new Number Three?,3,8,Dwight
Sucks to be you.,6,19,Michael

"Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?",2,8,Michael
Ow.,9,7,Angela
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...,4,12,Michael
"Just stop it. What's the... oh, whoa! Where did that come from?",3,6,Michael
"Wait, when you say ""that guy"", you mean you?",5,2,Kevin
"One second, one second, one second. So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?",7,5,Darryl
I could work here. I could see this.,5,20,Pam
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?,1,3,Dwight
"Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.",2,3,Dwight
"Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?",7,21,Michael
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?,3,8,Michael
"[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.",8,5,Darryl

She's right Pam.,9,10,Dwight
"Senator Lipton, nice to see you.",9,5,Oscar
"Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!",8,17,Dwight
"Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.",6,16,Jim
"Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?",6,2,Dwight
Well rested.,5,8,Dwight
"Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!",9,11,Dwight
No. No.,5,26,Michael
"I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!",7,11,Erin
Wallace is going to freak.,5,12,Michael
"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.",1,6,Michael
It's going very well.,5,12,Dwight
The cow jumped over the moon.,7,13,Erin
Eleven months.,7,17,Jim
Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do.,3,19,Andy
"Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.",8,15,Jim
No.,7,21,Michael
"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.",4,4,Michael
I know.,6,16,Pam
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.,5,3,Michael
I have rights.,6,24,Michael
"It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!",9,3,Darryl
Sure.,5,20,Pam
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.,3,22,Michael
"No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be.",6,9,Michael
"West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River",5,21,Erin
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,1,3,Michael
Bestiality. Yeah.,7,24,Phyllis
"That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...",2,4,Dwight
So weird that there is no paperwork.,7,2,Pam
"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",8,8,Pam
They sent a limo.,6,10,Michael
I’m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don’t exist like ghosts or mummies.,8,5,Kevin
What's our presentation about?,8,15,Dwight
Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We’re running late. Let’s get him inside.,9,19,Dwight
Oh. Like nobody.,7,22,Jim
"Yeah, good job. Well done.",7,3,Michael
"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem ""too eager,"" so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.",6,15,Andy
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.,8,4,Angela
The big gun thing. Stop!,7,5,Jim
Kevin! Doesn't apply.,8,3,Dwight
"Ok. That's not appropriate. Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go.",6,4,Michael
Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.,2,22,Jim
"You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back.",5,8,Jim
Go. Any questions?,6,5,Michael
"I think you have the wrong number, Michael.",5,22,Dwight
"Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!",9,4,Jim
"What? What, what, what, what, what?",8,18,Jim
Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.,8,8,Ryan
Because I would kick his ass.,2,6,Michael
I shredded it.,4,14,Angela
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.,7,19,Michael
Copy. Thank you.,7,2,Dwight
"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.",7,5,Jim
"She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.",4,1,Angela
Not now! Private time!,9,22,Dwight
I don't know if I wanna do this.,3,19,Michael
"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",8,12,Andy
"You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.",5,1,Michael
"Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...",2,4,Jim
You a sports fan?,9,1,Jim
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.,2,1,Kevin
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.,6,4,Pam
"No. No, no. There was wind.",5,11,Michael
"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?",2,4,Michael
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?,8,5,Phyllis
"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.",6,23,Pam
"Mm... not really, no.",3,21,Jim
Let me see it!,8,3,Darryl
"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",3,8,Pam
"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",3,21,Michael
I'm not following you.,5,22,Michael
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? May I?,5,6,Dwight
No...,3,18,Michael
You can't possibly be serious.,7,10,Dwight
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.,7,19,Dwight
"Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...",5,12,Michael
"No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.",2,18,Angela
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.,9,14,Dwight
"No, I--I think you should make time for it.",7,9,Angela
S”il vous plait…dites-Moi…Ugggghhh les Bleagh!,9,3,Erin
Sorry. That was a family emergency.,5,6,Jim
Thanks a bunch.,3,22,Michael
"Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.",3,9,Michael
The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!,4,2,Michael
Expenses.,2,13,Michael
"So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.",3,14,Michael
"Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?",6,7,Michael
I don't understand.,3,8,Michael
Whatever David wants.,5,18,Michael
"Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.",2,14,Jim
But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. And I just had to get her clean.,8,21,Pam
And there's my talking point.,8,12,Jim
"Exactly. Help me po’ mouth, Darryl.",9,3,Andy
"Blah, blah, blah, blah...",4,14,Michael
Good for him.,7,11,Michael
"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",6,15,Michael
Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. Bye. Okay.,7,7,Michael
Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas. Hi-yah!!!!! Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!,8,10,Dwight
"I forget it, brutha.",2,7,Ryan
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?,5,22,Andy
You said no to this one!,7,6,Darryl
"Turn around, turn around. Come on.",3,10,Michael
You were supposed to be my friend.,9,8,Angela
Thank you.,2,8,Pam
Tell me before I come there.,2,12,Pam
"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",6,3,Jim
Hey let me escort you to your desk.,6,2,Michael
And that her butt refuses to quit!,5,1,Michael
"Open the door, Jim.",8,8,Phyllis
Explain what you think that is.,5,23,Ryan
"And I’d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I’m… I’m not so sure I’d like living in Philadelphia.",9,11,Darryl
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.,9,13,Dwight
Amazing.,9,23,Dwight
Nope.,5,6,Jim
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?,2,4,Michael
"I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?",8,24,Andy
Ohh! Good-bye.,7,13,Jim
"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",6,5,Andy
Why don't you just buy the whole song?,3,10,Dwight
Okey dokey.,8,21,Andy
Okay.,3,8,Michael
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.,6,8,Pam
I want to do it.,2,10,Dwight
"Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?",5,1,Kevin
Why is Packer back?,7,17,Jim
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,6,16,Pam
"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",7,6,Jim
"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",1,2,Michael
"No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.",3,10,Angela
I get to kiss her forehead. I had a good time hanging out this weekend.,5,7,Andy
What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?,9,2,Kevin
"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.",8,14,Jim
You guys gotta be kidding.,5,24,Michael
"Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.",7,12,Michael
Got that. Get down.,8,16,Ryan
"Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?",8,19,Kevin
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.,3,12,Phyllis
"Hey, how'd you do?",7,12,Darryl
"Yes, yes. Assistant to the regional manager.",1,5,Michael
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.,7,9,Ryan
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,7,1,Michael
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.,7,15,Erin
"I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.",6,17,Erin
"Okay, I'll drive.",7,12,Dwight
Ho-oh!,5,9,Michael
Well...,6,20,Michael
"Oh, well.",3,13,Michael
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.,9,13,Dwight
Apoplexy.,7,13,Erin
"Yeah. I know, me too.",3,8,Pam
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.,4,1,Pam
"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.",7,15,Michael
More like fall cleaning.,9,7,Oscar
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.,9,3,Pam
Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,7,11,Michael
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.,6,4,Andy
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.,4,4,Jim
"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.",8,21,Dwight
Who?,7,15,Michael
Mm-hmm.,2,5,Pam
Yeah. All right!,4,12,Andy
"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.",8,21,Andy
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.,7,3,Erin
"No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.",7,9,Michael
Ok.,3,3,Michael
"No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.  John Mark and John David.",5,16,Angela
Glass of water would be a start.,4,1,Jim
"And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.",5,22,Jim
"Yeah, you should see her naked.",3,6,Michael
There are no wrong answers.,8,2,Kevin
Hey.,8,13,Jim
I'm like a quarter of the way through.,7,10,Andy
My marriage is in danger. I don’t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.,9,8,Angela
I'll take care of that for you. Thanks.,5,6,Michael
"So long Darryl, feel better... He's lying.",6,2,Dwight
"It's okay, honey. It's okay, it's okay.",8,13,Pam
"Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.",7,4,Andy
"No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",6,5,Michael
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.,5,7,Dwight
Where did you see it?,8,16,Dwight
"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",6,23,Andy
"They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.",6,4,Michael
"It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.",6,9,Oscar
"I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!",8,4,Angela
"Okay, good, okay. What bank?",4,4,Oscar
I will call you when it is time.,5,6,Michael
I do? Well--Where is that bowl?,5,24,Michael
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.,8,20,Jim
He was dead the whole time.,3,6,Dwight
"Congratulations, Dwight.",9,21,Pam
That’s very true. Get the hell outta here.,9,22,Dwight
"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.",2,11,Dwight
Now you got it.,5,25,Michael
He’s not that smart. He doesn’t know where I hid his duck.,9,22,Kevin
"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",6,3,Jim
Pro.,7,15,Michael
"Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.",8,16,Erin
"You had me at ""Sex.""",7,9,Kevin
MIS... MI... What are you doing?,8,4,Dwight
"We don't take debit cards, anyway.",4,10,Dwight
"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again.",5,13,Jim
Big day for you.,9,21,Andy
"Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. That's what she said!",7,21,Michael
Thought we were playing for fun.,4,8,Phyllis
"No, thank you, Angela.",9,8,Oscar
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.,7,15,Dwight
Go Meredith. Nice moves.,6,4,Erin
"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",7,18,Michael
"What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?",2,18,Michael
"Very brave choice also, I thought.",4,6,Pam
"Oh, ok, cool.",2,9,Jim
"It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!",3,23,Dwight
"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",3,9,Michael
"You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?",3,10,Jim
When are you leaving?,2,17,Pam
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.,9,17,Oscar
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.,3,21,Jim
"Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak.",7,3,Andy
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.,6,18,Andy
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?,9,18,Dwight
"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",3,3,Dwight
It's the lever on the side.,2,14,Jim
Uh you tell me,8,7,Andy
"I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.",8,18,Darryl
Listen to this.,8,20,Oscar
"Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?",7,8,Pam
"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",3,3,Michael
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.,6,5,Michael
"What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.",6,2,Michael
"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.",2,20,Dwight
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!,3,19,Dwight
You read my mind.,8,20,Dwight
That's it?Man on,1,3,Michael
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I’m a man. So I’m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.,9,23,Oscar
Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.,5,23,Jim
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.,2,10,Ryan
Let's get back to the matter at hand.,6,6,Michael
-I just don't know if I can do it.,5,22,Jim
"Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.",7,13,Andy
"Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. Welcome.",6,13,Dwight
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.,8,17,Andy
So what's going on? What I miss?,2,16,Michael
"Stop, stop, stop.",7,2,Jim
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?,3,7,Pam
Conference room everyone.,6,9,Jim
Where the hell is that?,2,22,Michael
"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.",1,1,Michael
"And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.",8,4,Dwight
"No, you will not.",8,13,Angela
Love you too.,9,5,Andy
Ayyyy!,5,16,Michael
"The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.",8,13,Angela
Can you breathe okay?,6,7,Oscar
Almost quittin' time.,2,9,Michael
Sure.,7,10,Pam
"I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...",7,19,Andy
"I don't think so, no.",1,3,Dwight
I thought you had already... left.,3,8,Jim
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.,2,21,Dwight
No. We heard that about Jim.,6,1,Angela
"Yeah, I hear ya.  It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting...",5,16,Michael
Cool.,7,11,Pam
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?,2,10,Kevin
"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.",6,1,Michael
I don’t think I should.,8,1,Pam
"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? ""Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.""",8,20,Dwight
Wait. I don't have my scarf.,7,15,Pam
"Well, those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?",2,2,Darryl
I think you should retrace your steps.,2,6,Jim
I want eye contact.,6,23,Angela
"Thanks, girl.",2,20,Dwight
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?,2,13,Pam
"Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.",5,11,Angela
Yeah! Oh ho ho,2,14,Michael
No. I won't say it.,6,20,Kevin
But you hurt your hand.,8,21,Erin
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,6,22,Michael
"Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.",9,4,Jim
"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.",4,2,Michael
"Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.",6,17,Dwight
"No, I swallowed a crown.",5,20,Phyllis
"This was my decision, not yours.",9,22,Jim
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery…,8,16,Kevin
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.,6,8,Pam
"No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?",2,18,Michael
"Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.",6,10,Oscar
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We’re 100 percent staffed up.,8,9,Andy
It's just...,5,1,Oscar
"Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  I would like to start saying my goodbyes [",3,23,Michael
We're going to have a baby.,6,16,Michael
"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.",2,7,Michael
"Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.",5,7,Michael
Not literally.,2,15,Dwight
"Yeah, I’m alternating.",9,2,Erin
"Come on Jim, you're killing her!",8,19,Kevin
Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.,6,2,Dwight
This is my favorite day.,6,20,Angela
Will you?,3,8,Michael
"- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.",6,13,Michael
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.,5,17,Michael
That's ok.,8,10,Jim
"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",3,5,Michael
"They are not. Yes, they are.  That's my girlfriend.",2,8,Michael
So I'm not in trouble?,2,2,Michael
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.,2,22,Dwight
Uh oh...,7,21,Dwight
We're not-,7,5,Michael
"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.",4,3,Andy
Really?,4,7,Michael
which I will not be a part of-,5,5,Andy
You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!,6,15,Dwight
"Who, Steve?",2,11,Jim
Is that Michael?,2,19,Jim
We should probably get back.,4,9,Jim
"I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.",3,9,Dwight
"I can do that.Graphics guy Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.",4,13,Pam
"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?",6,24,Andy
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,5,10,Jim
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,2,15,Michael
I don't like that story babe.,4,9,Michael
"Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said ""Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.""",6,22,Darryl
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...,3,8,Dwight
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.,9,4,Jim
"Welcome back, ""Dad!""",6,17,Erin
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.,6,21,Dwight
You can owe me.,5,10,Darryl
It's just not prudent Michael.,5,19,Oscar
"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",2,22,Michael
"Oh, thank you.",5,7,Michael
Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.,6,16,Pam
"I'm scared, too.",6,16,Michael
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.,7,12,Pam
"It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way.",3,8,Dwight
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.,7,11,Angela
But then no one can see us.,2,3,Dwight
"What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",8,9,Dwight
"Well, I updated it.",8,18,Ryan
"Yeah, come on in. I’m just on hold with another talent agency. It’s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there’s more. 251. 252. I can’t even keep up!",9,19,Andy
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.,7,4,Dwight
"Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds.",2,4,Dwight
This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.,2,6,Dwight
Wow! Sorry!,5,25,Phyllis
Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding!,8,10,Erin
"Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.",7,18,Michael
"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.",3,11,Michael
Hey!,2,14,Jim
"Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.",6,10,Oscar
"Yeah, if you don't mind.",3,12,Ryan
Angela.,7,12,Pam
It'll all be goat.,8,4,Dwight
Okay.,7,13,Michael
Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.,9,20,Erin
"Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.",7,8,Dwight
Can you send Dwight in here?,4,7,Michael
"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.",5,5,Dwight
"Nope. I, like you, have never been here before.",6,4,Pam
"Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.",8,2,Dwight
That's from Superman?,2,8,Michael
"Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...",4,14,Phyllis
"No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.",2,13,Michael
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.,2,16,Angela
That's what who said?,4,7,Jim
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.,3,6,Pam
Come on.,5,22,Dwight
"Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that’s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. Check-in guy Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.",9,22,Andy
"Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?",4,6,Michael
"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",4,2,Jim
"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",2,8,Dwight
"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?",5,13,Michael
"I am hardly the problem, Jim.",5,1,Dwight
Let me help you us.,9,23,Phyllis
"Good, All right. Sounds great.",2,22,Michael
Why don't we make corn burgers?,4,14,Oscar
"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one ""What should we do to prepare for Y2K?""",2,8,Michael
"Anything you guys want. This is your time. Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it ""shmear?"" Like the cream cheese.",3,21,Michael
"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...",7,1,Jim
"That's why you have a ""Sent Mail"" folder.",6,11,Erin
That is true.,4,2,Michael
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,6,4,Dwight
"Uh, ""I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.""",1,5,Michael
Command central.,6,17,Dwight
"Hey, you have a second?",5,24,Jim
A month. You didn't hear it from me!,8,13,Oscar
Yes you are.,5,10,Michael
"Oh. Right, that style.",5,3,Jim
"Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.",6,16,Pam
"I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.",6,11,Michael
"In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...",7,23,Andy
"Pam, everybody!",2,1,Michael
None of this makes any sense to me!,9,9,Erin

What? Shirts on or off?,1,5,Dwight
"Look, I am not a gazillionaire. I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses. I have to stay within the parameters of my budget. I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique. I buy my suits the old fashioned way. I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay. And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier. And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin. And I did too. And I grabbed this suit. And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket. And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war. And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get. And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before. Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye. And she got it, she got the suit. But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit. And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.",3,18,Michael

"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer.

Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson’s a mean old grump. But would a grump make this? It’s me. It’s me.,9,23,Phyllis
"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?",2,10,Michael
"I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.",3,3,Michael
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.,9,20,Oscar
We thought.,7,21,Pam
Well you seem a little tired.,3,14,Pam
"Ooh, I love repartee.",6,19,Dwight
"All right, see you at one.",1,5,Michael
"Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!",5,25,Michael
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-,8,13,Dwight
I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.,6,10,Michael
"""Crazy diarrhea happening right now?"" Cause things can get real adult real fast.",6,11,Andy
Really? Anything.,7,22,Dwight
Get in here... everybody.,2,19,Michael
You will? Wanna do it right now?,6,2,Jim
Ask him about the party.,5,18,Dwight
"Hey guys let’s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight’s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he’s never, ever going to go back on it right?",8,9,Jim
"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.",8,21,Dwight
I was gonna go with this one.,6,6,Jim
I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.,6,9,Michael
Sounds beautiful!,7,21,Kevin
He's not going to be a murderer.,3,14,Michael
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.,3,11,Andy
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.,8,13,Erin
You guys ready to party?,3,6,Andy
"Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.",8,16,Oscar
"Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?",8,1,Andy
Single... OK.,3,19,Dwight
"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.",4,4,Andy
"Hello, Charles? Charles!",5,18,Angela
So when are we going out?,1,1,Pam
That's a common mistake.,6,17,Jim
I don't believe you. Continue.,2,22,Dwight
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.,3,17,Michael
"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",7,15,Jim
"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?",2,8,Michael
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?,8,10,Dwight
"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. ""You can't be on the team"", ""You can't move on to second grade"". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.",4,2,Michael
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.,7,11,Darryl
Do you have a gun?,9,8,Angela
"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.",5,1,Jim
"Cool, thank you.",3,8,Ryan
"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",1,3,Dwight
I will call him later with that message.,3,2,Michael
"No, it's in like ten minutes.",2,8,Michael
"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.",2,19,Michael
"You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.",8,12,Darryl
"Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial. Huh?",4,5,Michael
What?,2,5,Michael
"No, no, that makes total sense.",6,11,Kevin
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. Can I have your sunglasses?,9,5,Jim
Fine.,7,23,Dwight
What's up?,4,4,Pam
Cradle my head!,5,3,Dwight
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,6,15,Michael
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?,4,14,Michael
Oh my God. What century is this?,4,4,Pam
Dwight has a sister?,9,17,Oscar
"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.",1,2,Michael
"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.",5,18,Michael
"Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.",9,19,Andy
I don't know. I think so.,6,21,Michael
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.,9,20,Andy
It's Andy's fault.,6,20,Erin
"Good, good, good. I will see you.",5,22,Michael
De,7,20,Jim
"Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.",5,23,Jim
"Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...",1,4,Pam
"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",6,7,Jim
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me it was the tale from Jets.,7,8,Erin
We're back.,5,7,Ryan
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.,8,13,Jim
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.,8,23,Dwight
"You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.",3,8,Kevin
"Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! Que? QUE?",7,4,Dwight
"What a horrible, horrible movie that was.",3,10,Jim

"Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God... So good.",7,16,Pam
You're actually talking a lot.,5,16,Michael
"No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...",2,20,Oscar
"Seriously. No, really.",1,6,Michael
"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",3,8,Michael
I only brought the one.,4,13,Pam
"Well, everyone got one.",6,15,Erin
"Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.",2,4,Jim
"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",6,3,Michael
"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.",4,1,Angela
"Um, I...",2,2,Michael
OK...,1,1,Michael
Hellloo...,5,13,Michael
French Onion?,2,6,Pam
"Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.",6,6,Dwight
I think that's it!,9,18,Oscar
Apparently.,2,3,Angela
What's a dis... what's that?,3,21,Dwight
All you have to do it say it.,4,12,Dwight
"Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.",5,4,Dwight
Copy.,3,10,Dwight
"Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.",8,13,Erin
Are you good at homemade?,7,11,Phyllis
Losers.,8,1,Dwight
Please stop saying what. Can you take him?,6,4,Pam
Can I get you a tankard of mead?,4,14,Dwight
What are you guys doing?Vance Refrigeration Worker #1 Probably go grab dinner with my girlfriend. He's gonna be pulling his pud watching Skinemax.,2,16,Pam

"Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.",6,19,Michael
Michael!,6,21,Pam
Yoko shack.Male voice ...thank you James.,3,8,Michael
We've already rescheduled seven times.,6,11,Erin
"Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-",4,6,Michael
"Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.",8,20,Erin
"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",8,21,Pam
Very interesting.,6,20,Pam
How is he gonna have grandkids?,6,10,Dwight
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,5,10,Dwight
"Back for more, huh?",9,9,Darryl
Do someone else.,2,20,Pam
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?,2,2,Jim
Hey! Good to have you back.,8,18,Phyllis
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm,7,15,Erin
That's nice.,4,9,Jim
Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.,7,15,Michael
This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.,5,7,Michael
I got thirsty. How'd it go?,2,17,Michael
"I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.",9,9,Phyllis
"Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.",7,14,Dwight
It's locked.,8,8,Jim
"Hey, I'm WUPHF.",7,9,Ryan
I'd rather have the bowl.,9,9,Phyllis
Ohh...Nah.,4,13,Michael
Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.,5,3,Darryl
"Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!",8,22,Darryl
Yeah.Andy and,6,17,Jim
Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.,5,26,Dwight
"To Oscar Martinez it's the ""Show Me the Money"" award! Yeah!",2,1,Michael
Where'd you get that?,3,18,Jim
"Oh, Michael.",6,14,Pam
"We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.",7,5,Dwight
It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.,6,8,Michael
Afghani.,2,22,Phyllis
Shhhh! Keep it down.,5,7,Michael
Have some faith in this idea!,7,9,Ryan
"Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.",5,25,Michael
What happened?,8,21,Jim
"Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.",3,21,Kevin
So maybe. See ya.,3,2,Michael
Nope. Just... Okay.,7,22,Jim
"Hi, Mr. Bart.",5,24,Dwight
That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...,7,8,Oscar
"OK, so then, when?",4,10,Pam
"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",2,21,Michael
Did... Karen get the job?,3,23,Pam
"Yes, we did.",6,3,Michael
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.,9,16,Erin
Will you roll those dice with me?,8,21,Ryan
I think green is kind of whoreish.,1,4,Angela
You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?,6,7,Pam
"Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.",3,4,Dwight
I can just continue to run it myself.,6,2,Michael
Could he still be seeing her?,6,23,Pam
I think you are wrong.,7,9,Michael
Is Packer here?,7,17,Michael
"All right, guys, stop.",8,19,Jim
"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?",6,9,Dwight
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.,8,10,Andy
"Ohh, God!",5,9,Michael
It's not even a thought—,9,3,Darryl
"Alright, after you.",2,7,Michael
"I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.",7,10,Dwight
"Really? What did they say? ""For a good time, call Michael Scott""?",2,1,Michael
"Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger’s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?",9,8,Dwight
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.,9,15,Andy
What happened to grape soda?,3,8,Pam
"Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.",8,22,Jim
"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, you can look the other way. Loo do do!",5,13,Andy
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,4,5,Michael
Shhh...,4,1,Michael
"You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing. ""La la la la la la la la la la!"" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!",5,11,Dwight
"Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.",7,21,Dwight
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.,3,16,Jim
That will not go over well.,6,3,Michael
"You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.Co-Worker 2 Dude, you should review movies.",4,4,Michael
There's no gum. There never was any gum.,9,14,Dwight
Just rock. Shh.,7,15,Dwight
"You too, have a good night.",1,6,Michael
On a boat.,9,15,Dwight
"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",2,12,Jim
Lose the twirl.,6,10,Phyllis
Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?,3,8,Michael
So what happened?,7,2,Pam
"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.",2,3,Dwight
"Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",6,11,Michael
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,6,23,Michael
Oh yeah.,2,9,Jim
What?Passer-by I'm Pam.,7,10,Dwight
Merry Christmas.,5,10,Dwight
"Ok, what are they?",2,7,Dwight
"They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.",7,13,Darryl
It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.,2,7,Michael
Who else? Who else? Ryan?,5,25,Michael
Hello! This is... the client.,7,24,Pam
Separate rooms.,5,14,Pam
Oh my God!,5,11,Pam
Michael Scarn!,7,16,Kevin
"It's right here on the desk, yeah.",2,5,Michael
"We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.",6,7,Andy
"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",3,23,Dwight
"Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?",2,14,Michael
"It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... I thought that would be cooler.",8,15,Andy
"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately three hours ago.",3,10,Jim
"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",3,4,Dwight
"Hey, hey...",1,5,Michael
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.,7,5,Dwight
"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?",8,5,Pam
"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",6,22,Michael
This is exciting! You’re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.,9,21,Dwight
We are closed! Come on.,8,17,Erin
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.,4,4,Pam
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.,1,1,Oscar
"Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",6,23,Michael
"Yeah. I mean, listen if we’re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.",9,5,Pam
"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",6,14,Jim
No. It's over between you two.,5,11,Andy
"Yeah, I'm betting one more.",6,19,Michael
See you there.,9,22,Oscar
"Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. Michael is terrified of bob.",5,16,Phyllis
Are you happy?,9,22,Pam
I’m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,9,13,Dwight
Do not panic.,2,4,Angela
But the branch is still mine?,5,18,Michael
We want the same things.,5,5,Michael
"All right, let's start.",4,5,Michael
"Oh, my God.",7,11,Pam
"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.",8,14,Dwight
"When I was growing up, my mom said, ""the sky's the limit."" I could do anything. Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer. But now, I, I'm not so sure.",4,14,Phyllis
No. I haven't thought of it.,5,9,Angela
What has gotten into you?,3,17,Michael
Good Valentine's.,5,16,Kevin
"I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.",7,5,Andy
"Michael, come on.",6,22,Dwight
"It's not safe, you don't have a license.",3,19,Darryl
There’s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?,9,1,Dwight
Okay Pam.,6,12,Oscar
"Oh, shhh... Come on.",3,5,Michael
"Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.",5,6,Dwight
"""We"" don't.",6,16,Dwight
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.,8,18,Pam
"No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.",4,10,Pam
Oh yeah. That's too bad.,2,17,Pam
"It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.",3,23,Andy
Midnight what?,8,7,Andy
"Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there.",1,4,Michael
"Okay, I know I’ve been crying easily today, but- I mean, that’s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it’s stupid. No. It’s wonderful. I’m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.",8,1,Pam
"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",6,4,Michael
"Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.",9,12,Pam
"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.",8,20,Andy
Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?,4,3,Michael
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.,8,20,Angela
"Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.",5,25,Michael
"Ok, you go to the store.",9,22,Angela
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.,3,13,Andy
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.,1,6,Michael
"All right, we're set.",5,1,Dwight
Here we go.,6,21,Michael
"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",4,6,Michael
"Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.",3,4,Michael
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?,8,10,Oscar
"I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.",4,11,Dwight
"Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",6,24,Michael
You dare me? How old are you?,2,19,Pam
"That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.",7,17,Kevin
No.,3,22,Michael
"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",8,20,Pam
"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?",1,6,Michael
Yes.,3,6,Michael
The thing you just said?,2,13,Kevin
"My home office, this is it.",2,9,Jim
"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.",6,23,Michael
"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",6,6,Michael
"... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum",3,10,Angela
What do you mean hmm-um?Pizza guy Not my problem.,4,3,Michael
"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",8,12,Andy
This is where we go,8,2,Kevin
No... way!,5,3,Jim
"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?",3,21,Dwight
"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",7,17,Michael
Count the last one.,6,19,Michael
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Excuse me.,7,11,Jim
"This could be the affair that you’re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. But uh, he’s probably not gay. He’s straight. He’s straight, so...",9,7,Oscar
"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",6,16,Andy
"I don't know, I don't know about that.",6,5,Michael
"Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second...",2,6,Jim
This is where I used to keep my computer.Pam's,2,2,Pam
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.,9,7,Pam
Do you want us to count to three?,3,22,Pam
That's good. He's throwing it.,7,15,Michael
"Thank you. ""Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted."" ""Have fun today, big guy."" ""Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.""",7,15,Darryl
I love their sandwiches too.,1,4,Jim
Uh...,6,7,Michael
"Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?",6,9,Michael
"Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?",7,21,Michael
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.,3,8,Michael
"My whole life, I have known two things I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.",4,14,Michael
"Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.",9,7,Erin
I'm trying but you need to-,8,10,Ryan
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?,9,4,Pam
"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",6,21,Dwight
"That's my wife you're talking about, man.",6,18,Michael
Ok.,2,8,Michael
My bad.,9,2,Darryl
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,2,21,Dwight
Just take her name off of everything.,9,9,Oscar
"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two Who is going-",8,11,Dwight
"Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!",7,17,Kevin
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,7,24,Jim
"OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",3,21,Michael
I know how you got it.,7,4,Kevin
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole.,8,1,Jim
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.,3,10,Michael
Yeah! Whoo!,8,2,Pam
He's right there. There he is.,3,14,Michael
"So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice.",2,18,Pam
"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?",6,3,Oscar
So this was all just a trick. You don’t really have any business to give?,9,7,Pam
Ukulele's happy?,7,12,Erin
"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",2,12,Michael
"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.",4,1,Michael
"Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?",7,17,Michael
"Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.",2,9,Jim
"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. ""Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.""",6,20,Jim
"Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?",9,6,Erin
Just cover up that bald patch.,3,15,Michael
"He really is, but not for long.  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.",6,9,Dwight
"Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.",8,22,Jim
Let me see it.,8,3,Darryl
Kevin has that lovability.,8,6,Andy

"Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.",4,4,Dwight
"Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?",7,6,Darryl
I changed my mind.,9,4,Andy
"I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.",7,20,Dwight
"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?",2,9,Pam
"Your problem now, Captain Jack.",2,11,Michael
"I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. Oh yeah!",8,11,Kevin
Don't do anything rash!,3,19,Dwight
Seagull.,8,16,Dwight
Yes.,4,3,Michael
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.,7,8,Dwight
"A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.",5,7,Michael
"No, that was a long time ago.",5,14,Pam
He just so happy to have a family plan.,9,23,Pam
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.,8,12,Dwight
"Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building.",5,19,Michael
"I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!",6,4,Jim
"Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.",7,10,Ryan
"Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?",2,10,Kevin

Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,7,7,Dwight
"Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.",4,11,Michael
"Yeah, it won't shred magazines.",7,21,Kevin
How does that work?,6,23,Andy
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?,7,3,Michael
"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",2,13,Dwight
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,3,7,Pam
"What is that? The ""Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?"" There's no such thing as the ""Committee to Plan Parties.""",3,10,Angela
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.,9,9,Jim
"Oh, Dawson's Creek.",4,9,Jim
Ryan is causing some problems. And you were always good at handling him. What should I do to control him?,4,2,Michael
"Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.",5,5,Michael
"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, ""Would an idiot do that?"" And if they would, I do not do that thing.",3,16,Dwight
"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.",7,1,Andy
Bankruptcy?,7,9,Oscar
"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",4,10,Michael
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,9,14,Pam
"The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... Oh well.",3,16,Jim
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?,5,11,Andy
"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",3,2,Michael
What position did you use to conceive?,9,4,Dwight
"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",7,6,Michael
"OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.",6,9,Michael
"Thank you, Erin.",8,24,Andy
Are you on email?,5,16,Kevin
"This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.",6,6,Ryan
It looks cute though.,4,4,Michael
"Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...",1,4,Angela
"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation ""I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls."" Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",2,15,Michael
That's my favorite.,7,15,Erin
"Ye - OK, yes.",3,21,Michael
"It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says ""Hey mon,"" everybody says ""Hey mon"" back.",3,11,Michael
"The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that’s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I’m not risking that again.",9,22,Jim
"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.",2,7,Michael
A bat! Impressive...,7,4,Dwight
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.,4,14,Michael
You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.,6,11,Jim
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.,2,2,Angela
She’s dead. She was hit by a bus.,8,7,Erin
Who says that?,5,11,Andy
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.,5,19,Kevin
"At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.",9,21,Andy
"Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.",3,23,Andy
I just think you’re going into this a little fast.,9,21,Darryl
Took me all night.,5,18,Michael
"Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.",9,7,Dwight
"Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.",5,1,Pam
"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?",7,10,Pam
Waste of time.,7,10,Dwight
"Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?",2,22,Phyllis
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?,6,1,Kevin
"Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...",2,1,Michael
"Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.",7,9,Dwight
So which way are you leaning?,5,19,Michael
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.,7,8,Dwight
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.,5,17,Dwight
Why would someone hug you?,7,11,Oscar
"So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point ""B"", uh... the beet juice cleanse?",6,23,Dwight
"Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing ""moo"", I'm playing ""milk"". Whatever it takes.",7,13,Erin
"Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",3,12,Michael
I... won't.  I won't.,3,3,Michael
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.,3,9,Jim
All right! What is going on here?,4,8,Dwight
"I'm awful, aren't I?",6,23,Michael
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.,3,8,Angela
I don't know. He looks pretty scrappy.,2,6,Jim
"No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.",5,12,Kevin
"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",7,11,Pam
"No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.",9,21,Darryl
You're kidding.,4,11,Michael
"Oy. Andy, what’s going on?",9,5,Erin
"Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.",7,10,Andy
"Aw. Well, hang in there, okay? You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.",3,1,Michael
Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!,7,9,Kevin
"Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.",1,2,Michael
Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.,6,1,Andy
I'll glance at it.,2,17,Dwight
You can write a book about chairs.,8,11,Jim
"It's uh, it's in beta testing.",8,3,Dwight
"Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.",8,8,Andy
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.,3,8,Dwight
Eww.,4,1,Jim
And Gromit. Jan? Is Jan there?,3,22,Michael
"Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!",3,18,Pam
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,6,7,Jim
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,1,3,Dwight
Sounds like you're doing alright.,8,22,Pam
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,6,3,Jim
"My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.",3,16,Kevin
Get in the car. Get... get in the car.,3,5,Dwight
"So, you can tell your clients “Unleash the power of the pyramid.”",8,2,Dwight
"I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we’re good. Yeah. We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.",9,8,Oscar
"I am a grown-up, Jim.",6,7,Michael
You'll see me in small claims court!,6,19,Angela
"I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!",9,5,Andy
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.,5,11,Phyllis
"I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun….and you did that.",8,2,Jim
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.,7,11,Angela
This is not a test! Can you leave?!,2,4,Dwight
"Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.",5,8,Michael
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.,9,15,Andy
"Kevin, no.",8,12,Oscar
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.,3,22,Dwight
You were a Jet?,2,6,Michael
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.,9,21,Dwight
"Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.",5,1,Jim
Come on. He'll listen to you.,3,19,Jim
But then you wouldn't have me here.,2,5,Dwight
"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",5,17,Michael
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...,4,7,Angela
Freedom fries. Yeah.,3,2,Pam
Yes?,6,23,Michael
Can you please stop staring at me?,2,19,Kevin
"Come on, get inside.",2,12,Jim
Maybe some spagh-etti.,1,2,Kevin
"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",6,1,Jim
Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?,5,3,Michael
"That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.",8,11,Ryan
Completely unacceptable.,5,25,Angela
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.,3,22,Michael
I just saw him.,2,12,Michael
"No I’m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn’t, I’m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don’t like to throw around the b-word, but I’m going to be a huge bitch to you.",9,1,Andy
"Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!",8,22,Dwight
I'm saying no.,8,21,Andy
"Oh, and I get to carry it.",4,1,Jim
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.,9,17,Dwight
"Yes, good luck with that.",3,11,Michael
"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",7,14,Michael
Aww.,8,4,Pam
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...,3,5,Dwight
"Okay, so what do you want to do?",6,16,Jim
"Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...",3,19,Michael
Porque es muy rapido.,8,3,Jim
"What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim!",7,11,Pam
Not so fast.,7,18,Dwight
Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.,6,8,Andy
"Wow, that's not such a bad idea.",6,11,Jim
Okay.,6,16,Michael
"""Don't sleep with your boss""? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?",2,8,Dwight
Answer the door.,5,17,Michael
"Oh, also, while you’re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.",9,21,Jim
"I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.",4,3,Phyllis
"Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six? Anyone know Joanna on that show? In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So...",5,2,Ryan
I will pay you whatever it takes.,9,13,Dwight
"Okay, oh! All right.",7,12,Michael
I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.,7,13,Michael
That would have been funny.,6,20,Pam
Food!,4,9,Pam
"Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?",5,2,Jim
"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?",3,22,Michael
Let it ride. Let it all ride.,2,22,Oscar
"It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?",5,23,Michael
I can save the branch.,3,3,Dwight
Are you serious?,8,12,Jim
"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?",8,9,Andy
Wittle Andy is afwaid.,5,25,Andy
Yep.,4,3,Jim
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?,5,25,Kevin
"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.Pizza guy This is stupid.",4,3,Michael
"Okay, I’ll do it.",8,17,Jim
I should probably get back to...,4,12,Pam
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,3,8,Jim
This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.,2,3,Jim
Right here. We have a lot of fun.,4,13,Michael
"""You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.""",6,16,Ryan
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.,6,12,Erin
"Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. So, what have we learned?  Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.",5,13,Dwight
"Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim. Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.",2,9,Michael
She's right on my way home from work.,6,6,Michael
Cece went down.,7,7,Pam
"and I’m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?",8,2,Jim
On your left!,4,1,Michael
That’s a bit extreme.,9,7,Dwight
"Yes. My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  Tell Meredith I said it another time .",4,8,Michael
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.,4,5,Angela
"Guys, who's Holly?",7,11,Erin
"And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...",4,3,Michael
Why's he talking to Holly?,7,17,Dwight
"One dance, all of us together.",9,22,Erin
I know that we need to cut costs. We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.,3,3,Dwight
"I'm in. I'm in. Here we go. Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone!",1,5,Michael
"My old art room. Oh, maybe it's still here! No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.",4,13,Pam
Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.,2,7,Michael
That is a demerit.,3,21,Dwight
"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",5,16,Jim
Probably just Kelly.,5,6,Jim
Was that hot or what?,5,9,Andy
Did he threaten you?,6,5,Dwight
"Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like…z64$8. Not that exactly Jim, something like that.",8,6,Ryan
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,7,11,Dwight
You mean on a weekend?,6,3,Jim
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.,6,23,Michael
"Finish your cake, Helene.",6,8,Michael
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.,3,10,Andy
"He said limousine, so...",6,10,Erin
"Well, it better work.",6,23,Angela
He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order.,5,13,Kevin
Say it.,9,15,Andy
"I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.",6,14,Michael
"Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?",7,20,Jim
"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?",7,22,Pam
"OK. Phyllis, you say? Hmm.",3,21,Michael
"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",5,20,Michael
"I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.",7,8,Erin
"Hey, hey, hey. I’ll do one thing with y’all.",9,22,Darryl
I like that one.,4,14,Pam
"What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem.  It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer.",3,1,Jim

OK. I'll call you later.,9,2,Andy
You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!,2,8,Dwight
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,2,15,Michael
Daraas!  Does anyone here have fermented mare’s milk?,9,3,Dwight
I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.,2,8,Michael
I have the emergency contacts.,2,6,Ryan

Good. Keepin' 'em honest.,8,3,Andy
We said part not all.,9,5,Pam
"Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?",6,14,Oscar
I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,4,5,Michael
Please Michael.,7,21,Phyllis
"Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --",7,22,Jim
"We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. Michael. Stop for a second.",5,20,Pam

"No, uh-",5,26,Jim
"Hey, how are those salads?",7,3,Andy
Thank you.,5,5,Pam
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.,8,21,Dwight
They have one of those?,5,7,Michael
"Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.",4,13,Michael
"Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.",1,5,Michael
"An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes.",3,19,Michael
LOVE the hair.,5,21,Jim
"Hi, Mema. It's Michael.",6,4,Michael
"Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.",8,3,Andy

Not doing that.,7,12,Dwight
"It's ok, they're with me.",2,12,Michael
"So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?",2,14,Jim
"Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.",8,11,Andy
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! Deck the halls with crappy gifts...,6,12,Michael
"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?",8,20,Jim
Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!,3,3,Michael
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?,7,11,Pam

That is not okay dude.,6,6,Andy
"When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. Or better yet, like this.

"Ahh, that's mine.",5,8,Michael
"Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.",5,21,Dwight
Made love? I don't know.,7,8,Phyllis

"It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.",8,4,Andy
Come here,9,23,Kevin

Thank you very much!",3,5,Michael
"Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?",8,8,Erin

"Oh, then pick TV.",5,15,Kevin
"Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.",3,20,Michael

Long story short Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.,3,15,Michael
What about the rest of you?,5,25,Michael
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.,7,12,Michael
Scranton suits you.,4,2,Ryan
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... working perfectly.,5,9,Michael
"Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?",6,3,Ryan
We are good to goooo!,8,16,Pam

My whole life is a booger bubble!,9,16,Andy
"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",8,7,Jim
"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?",8,6,Dwight
"Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.",6,16,Jim
Can I help you?,5,21,Erin

"This is your job, Halpert.",3,16,Dwight
A little warm.,9,23,Andy
He's a gun nut.,2,5,Pam
"Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",6,1,Michael
And then we checked the fax machine.,3,4,Jim
"Oh, I stand corrected.",8,7,Jim
"Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.",7,14,Dwight
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,2,22,Michael
How much?,2,10,Pam
"Well, but it-",8,24,Andy
"No, that was my Sensei.",2,6,Dwight
"We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...",5,18,Dwight
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...,1,4,Jim
You didn't run for me...,4,1,Kevin
I just talked to my advisor. Failing.,5,7,Pam
I didn't think it did.,2,17,Ryan
I need to get out of this dress.,9,23,Pam
"I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.",4,4,Andy
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.,3,10,Angela
"Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.",2,14,Pam
What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?,3,23,Pam

What are you doing?,3,22,Jim

Okay.,5,5,Michael

You're not having sex.,2,8,Jim
"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",5,10,Michael
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?,2,18,Michael

"Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",3,21,Jim
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.,9,5,Andy

But who was that guy?,3,20,Andy
Foul! Foul!,1,5,Michael
"No, no. What do I do?",3,23,Michael
"Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.",8,22,Kevin
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?,3,19,Kevin

Mosquito.,8,14,Jim
"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",6,3,Jim
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,1,6,Michael
"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.",7,10,Dwight
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?,7,24,Andy
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn’t stop crying?,8,5,Erin

"All good, Santa.",7,11,Andy
Wow. Late every day this week.,7,2,Dwight

Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.,4,1,Michael
Okay.Andy &,6,1,Dwight
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.,6,7,Michael
"See ya, drive safely.",4,3,Michael
"Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.",7,14,Andy
"No, no, really not necessary.",5,12,Michael
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music,8,22,Pam
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?,5,9,Angela
"Well, deal with this.",6,24,Michael
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,2,21,Michael
"Love. Marriage. Baby carriage. Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song. Jan and I had love. We did not have marriage. We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",4,10,Michael
Yeah.,3,21,Michael
Very funny Jim.,8,23,Dwight
Pizza rolls.,4,7,Andy
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.,4,14,Kevin
"Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.",7,10,Pam
"Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...",3,4,Michael
"Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.",3,14,Michael
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. That...,5,17,Michael
"It's gorgeous, Angela.",7,24,Pam
"No. Not me, him.",7,17,Michael
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,5,17,Dwight
"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",8,7,Dwight
I want that vice-presidency.,8,15,Dwight
"Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.",1,6,Michael
"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.",2,12,Michael
And I've dated four women in the last--,5,5,Michael
"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?",4,6,Michael
"Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other’s minds. You’re trying to give your wife this job.",9,22,Dwight
Yes boss.,3,17,Pam
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,3,5,Jim
All righty.,5,11,Andy
"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!",3,4,Dwight
"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",6,18,Jim
You're welcome.,3,2,Michael
I do really want him.,7,24,Erin
"No, this is a power suit.",3,18,Michael
"Don't call her ""the mom.""",6,6,Jim
"That’s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?",9,22,Jim
"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...",5,17,Andy
"No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?",1,2,Dwight
"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.",5,24,Michael
Merry Christmas!,3,10,Dwight
So what are you going to do?,4,6,Jim
"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.",1,5,Pam
Kelly.,5,1,Ryan
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?,7,21,Dwight
Yeah.Edward R.,2,18,Michael
"Yes, yes, yes!",8,23,Andy
"Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...",6,16,Pam
"Uh, 93 million miles.",7,24,Andy
"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",3,8,Dwight
"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",2,6,Michael
I think he left.,5,18,Phyllis
"You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.",9,21,Dwight
"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.",5,20,Michael
Just hush.,7,15,Dwight
"Go, Dwight Jr!",9,1,Darryl
"Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.",8,16,Darryl
Split the difference?,8,13,Jim
"Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.",3,21,Angela
"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",4,10,Michael
"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",3,22,Michael
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?,9,14,Pam
You're lying.,2,8,Dwight
"Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.",7,12,Andy
"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.",1,2,Michael
You drive.,3,5,Ryan
"Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.",3,16,Michael
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.,7,18,Michael
"Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?",2,7,Michael
We started selling balloons.,9,15,Phyllis
Back to work. Still waitin' on that coffee.,3,23,Michael
"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.Ex-client Maybe you should leave.",4,2,Dwight
Because that's all it takes.,3,3,Michael
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.,8,10,Dwight
Where's my car? Come on.,7,3,Angela
Wing.,5,20,Dwight
"Um, what should we talk about?",8,2,Pam
Yes you can.,6,16,Dwight
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?,8,2,Angela
I’m so sorry. I hate this. You’re better.,9,7,Pam
"Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.",6,19,Erin
I can't believe that's not working.,4,4,Pam
"Come on, we'll all go.",5,16,Oscar
"""I guess I missed you."" I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?",2,8,Michael
"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.",8,14,Jim
You never said anything.,6,7,Michael
$30.,8,22,Darryl
And she called it nuts?,8,7,Dwight
"I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.",9,15,Erin
"First guy says ""Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn"". And the second guy says, ""Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort"". And the third guy says ""I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe"".",2,7,Michael
"Yes, Jim’s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",9,1,Pam
Polluticorn wishes.,6,10,Dwight
I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.,5,23,Dwight
"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -",5,17,Michael
Should be fun.,3,16,Pam
"I don’t know, Angela. I’m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.",9,7,Oscar
He stopped it!,8,6,Oscar
"Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.",7,15,Kevin
"Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",7,17,Michael
"Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!",4,12,Michael
"No, I didn't. Huh, what?",2,2,Michael
This is combo number seven.,8,2,Andy
"Um, stimulate the nipples.",6,16,Erin
Wait. He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?,8,18,Dwight
"And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.",2,13,Dwight
"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.",1,2,Michael
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.,6,23,Ryan
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. Her life is a complete sham!,9,6,Kevin
Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known...,2,9,Phyllis
"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.",4,2,Michael
Hi. I'm Kevin. Where did you find her?,3,15,Kevin
"Oh, no, Kevin, it’s not a joke. Angela’s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.",9,12,Pam
"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-",5,18,Michael
Pull the poop out of the toilets.,8,24,Andy
"Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---Ad guy 1 Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---",4,5,Michael
Fudge?,2,6,Ryan
"Thanks a lot guys, Good job.",4,11,Jim
"Hold on, hold on. Is this him?",8,23,Jim
Isn't that thing huge?,4,6,Jim
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.,6,19,Michael
"Uh, ugh, ohhhh...",2,12,Dwight
"OK, I think I can help here.",3,10,Jim
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... It's me. I'm Dwight.,7,24,Dwight
Yes.,6,4,Michael
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.,3,14,Angela
There is no book. There's only a survival guide.,6,8,Dwight
"No! No! Jim, Jim, don't, don't...",4,5,Michael
"I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.",5,19,Jim
"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",6,16,Michael
People red vine.,9,8,Angela
"Morning, honey-pile.",6,17,Michael
"Yeah, alright Kev why don’t you come with us?",8,2,Jim
I can't see half of the things.,4,2,Phyllis
"No, it's not, because you don't really work here.",8,19,Jim
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---,1,6,Michael
We could put that in orange juice.,7,3,Jim
"Don't know, don't care.",7,17,Michael
"Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.",2,4,Dwight
Oh it's...,7,13,Erin
Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,5,10,Michael
Hi!,2,9,Pam
"Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.",5,9,Kevin
Ooh.,9,23,Jim
"Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-",2,9,Michael
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I’m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.,8,7,Andy
"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.",8,13,Jim
"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!",8,14,Dwight
I got his pants.,2,6,Michael
Great.,4,7,Pam
"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.",8,21,Pam
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,2,20,Jim
Yeah?,4,10,Michael
Mmhmm.,4,12,Michael
"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?",6,1,Michael
Italians don't wear pockets.,3,18,Michael
"Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?",2,17,Phyllis
Okay. Okay.,7,15,Michael
This office is cursed.  And we need to do something about it.,4,1,Michael
Yes. I'm very excited.,3,5,Ryan
"Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were—slave owners.",9,3,Oscar
We like Cugino's,6,13,Michael
That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.,6,9,Dwight
"No, why would you think that?",7,24,Jim
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?,7,14,Pam
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.,1,2,Michael
Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.,6,4,Andy
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.,4,8,Michael
I don't think you understand -,6,18,Jim
"Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?",8,21,Ryan
"I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.",3,23,Michael
"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.",4,6,Michael
"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",7,17,Michael
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?,3,23,Oscar
Um... you wanna buy it?,3,16,Pam
"Oh, Yes!",9,23,Kevin
No games?,8,9,Andy
"What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it’s in order? I haven’t been trained for this.",9,11,Erin
Are they looking at me?,5,22,Jim
"Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?",3,3,Michael
There's a photo...,2,18,Dwight
"That’s the reason Kevin got fired. It’s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, “A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.” He was home by 445 that day.",9,23,Oscar
"Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.",1,6,Michael
"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.",9,16,Dwight
I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in.,6,11,Ryan
Kind of embarassing.,7,19,Darryl
"You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?",9,6,Dwight
"Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.",2,1,Michael
"Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.",7,12,Pam
"NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?",5,14,Michael
"Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.",1,4,Michael
"Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.",5,3,Jim
The next year he really stepped things up.,6,10,Jim
"I'm so sorry, I forgot.",8,18,Jim
"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.",4,8,Pam
He’s got a bank vault. That’s a start.,8,1,Jim
"You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, ""How could they do this to us?""",6,12,Michael
Think!,6,15,Dwight
"Oh, I'd love to but, um-",8,13,Phyllis
"What, Pam?",9,17,Angela
"It's not very well written, but you get the gist.",6,2,Michael
"No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.",6,4,Pam
Kelly ordered this online.,4,3,Darryl
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy. That guy is a whale. I'm gonna clean him out. This is really gonna get me out of a hole.,4,13,Kevin
That’s enough Kevin.,9,11,Oscar
No. I'm not going to...,3,15,Michael
"Thanks, man.",9,10,Darryl
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.,2,2,Angela
"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",1,6,Michael
Really?,4,3,Michael
"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.",8,3,Dwight
"Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...",5,9,Oscar
I'll be down in just a second. Holly?,5,5,Michael
Cici is Jim's daughter.,8,10,Andy
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.,9,17,Oscar
"Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.",3,18,Michael
Kickoff. My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. Alright!,5,20,Jim
"Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They’re a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. We’d go in pretending to be family – brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.",9,11,Dwight
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You’re still at the 570 number?,9,13,Dwight
"Euughh… Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present… Hey.",8,16,Dwight
"Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.",3,7,Kevin
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.,9,3,Oscar
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,6,18,Michael
"You’re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we’ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.",9,21,Dwight
Let me get a picture of you guys.,5,7,Andy
"That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.",5,11,Dwight
"Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.",2,13,Michael
Yo. Dudeces.,9,4,Andy
"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.",6,21,Dwight
"Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.",3,22,Pam
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,6,21,Michael
Could go either way.,6,10,Jim
"Oh, no.",2,8,Pam
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.,8,6,Oscar
Yes.,1,5,Michael
We can make a difference here.,3,3,Angela
"Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.",1,6,Michael
"Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.",7,8,Pam
What do you need from me?,5,26,Dwight
"Not coming, have plans.",8,13,Dwight
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.,3,10,Michael
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.,3,4,Ryan
That's harsh.,3,22,Jim
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-,2,1,Michael
"Perfect, well, we're settled.",3,3,Michael
"Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?",7,5,Michael
"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",3,1,Pam
Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house.  Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.,3,3,Dwight
"Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.",4,2,Ryan
Thanks for meeting me.,7,19,Dwight
We're not listening.,5,11,Kevin
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.,9,3,Andy
"My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...",7,3,Andy
What if you’re being attacked by a 4’11” man who is penisless?,8,17,Andy
That sucks so much.,2,15,Kevin
Is he puffing out his chest?,8,7,Pam
I own a Chrysler.,6,19,Michael
"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.",6,24,Dwight
Angela is such a liar!,8,16,Pam
"Oh man, this is weird!",8,22,Kevin
Huh?,2,13,Ryan
"Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.",7,2,Pam
Not!,3,20,Dwight
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.,6,7,Erin
We're going to Utica?,4,6,Jim
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L,5,7,Andy
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.,9,6,Erin
I will grant you one wish.,5,10,Jim
"Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.",8,8,Ryan
Top of the Sunday morning to you.,7,7,Michael
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.,7,20,Dwight
"Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.",9,10,Darryl
"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...",7,15,Michael
Really?,7,14,Michael
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!,2,19,Michael
Right? Thank you! It’s just Philly. Everyone’s acting like it’s New York or Paris or London.,9,11,Pam
I figured it would save time.,1,2,Dwight
"The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 200 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.",7,2,Pam
"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",8,12,Jim
Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.,7,17,Erin
Andy!,9,15,Erin
"You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.",1,3,Dwight
Andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It’s just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you’re our regional manager. And guess what man? You don’t have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don’t believe me take a look at what’s on my head. I’m wearing a very pink hat. I’ve been getting weird looks all day because I’m pretty sure “DM does GB” means something kinda sexual. But guess who’s wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That’s huge.,8,8,Jim
"I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.",4,3,Angela
Are we ready?,3,20,Michael
"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",2,20,Michael
Nope.,7,9,Jim
What is Diwali?,3,6,Michael
"Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.",8,12,Ryan
"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.",1,4,Michael
Dwight!,9,6,Jim
I am not budging on the hat issue.,7,6,Michael
"And a high five! Oh, let's do this again!",8,22,Andy
When will the new copier be ready?,5,19,Kevin
"Two, one...",7,23,Angela
Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!,3,19,Dwight
"I am not asking, I am ordering.",8,9,Andy
Toby...,3,10,Dwight
Did you need me to take notes?,4,14,Pam
"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",7,11,Michael
Jimbo!,5,16,Jim
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.,7,2,Dwight
They've been in there for 45 minutes.,5,10,Jim
"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.",9,16,Dwight
He messed yours up to.,7,1,Oscar
The office.,3,7,Michael
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.,5,1,Michael
I'll call you when I get in.,9,9,Jim

Look who’s back.,9,21,Jim
"Yes, it is. Hello?",3,12,Angela

No I'm just sweating.,7,4,Andy
"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? See? They love me.",6,15,Michael
But not everyone...,5,9,Pam
Well... it's my own fault.,4,14,Dwight
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,8,7,Pam
"This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange",5,18,Michael
Would I make that up?,3,5,Pam

"Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!",2,17,Dwight

Yeah that sounds good.,4,9,Michael
So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.,4,3,Michael
"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—",9,13,Jim

Good.,5,1,Michael
"Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.",5,3,Angela

Stanley?,5,19,Michael
"Well, I've actually done a lot of thinking about that. And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids. And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth. And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.",3,23,Michael
"Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.",9,21,Angela
"I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now.",6,9,Jim
Nice. Right back where I like you. Can you make ten copies of this for me?,8,3,Ryan
I'm gonna write you up for not working.,5,1,Jim

"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",2,4,Jim
"Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him.

And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",7,17,Michael
"Okay, I'm not doing that.",8,9,Darryl
"Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?",6,1,Jim
You're a secretary! What do you know?,5,24,Dwight
"I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.",8,3,Ryan

"No, you're making this up!",3,5,Jim
"Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-",5,9,Angela
"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?",7,6,Jim
"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.",8,3,Andy

Not the car!,7,5,Pam
"Andrew, what about you?",6,16,Michael

"Michael, Michael I... ... inside.",1,3,Oscar
"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",2,6,Michael
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,3,1,Michael
You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.,4,6,Jim
Wow. Alright. Can’t wait to meet her.,8,2,Jim
"Oh, the other one's watching.",5,15,Kevin
"Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard.",1,5,Michael
Sounds tough.,1,3,Jim
"Right, that's good, good, pursue this.",1,4,Dwight
"Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.",2,1,Michael
"No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.",5,6,Jim
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.,6,4,Pam
"Thank you, Angela.",2,17,Dwight
OK.,1,2,Michael
"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?",4,10,Michael
"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",2,22,Jim
"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?",2,19,Jim
"Oh, you want me to be you?",2,5,Jim
"Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend.",2,14,Pam
I just wanted to say hi.,3,8,Jim
No you ahh.,7,17,Michael
"Oh, man, am I a woman?",1,2,Dwight
"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",6,16,Jim
"So, all the numbers adding up?",9,21,Dwight
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.,9,23,Ryan
"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.",4,13,Dwight
Does your stupid husband have it?,7,4,Michael
"Ah, definitely blue.",9,21,Jim
"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",3,8,Michael
"Dwight, I'm the boss.",4,11,Michael
"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.",2,2,Michael

Thank you very much.,5,19,Michael
"He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.",5,16,Oscar

"You don't. No, no.",6,23,Michael
"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.

Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.,8,20,Jim
"What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic.

Good times.,8,1,Darryl
"Val, I need the space.",8,13,Andy
"It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM! Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM!  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.",5,6,Dwight
Where is this from? That is so upsetting!,8,5,Oscar
So the monkey does the sex thing right here!,2,2,Dwight

"Either he goes, or I go.",2,21,Dwight

I was just getting a snack.,3,10,Phyllis
Wow. Things are really picking up.O',6,10,Michael
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!,8,22,Erin
"Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.",6,24,Darryl
Nnnngah!,5,2,Michael
"Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.",9,21,Angela
I almost lost it. That was too good.,2,8,Pam
"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -",6,14,Jim
No seafood.,3,7,Angela
"Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--",6,4,Michael
Addition by subtraction.,3,13,Andy
"Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.",5,6,Michael
Do you agree about what? Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute. Other waitress What're you talking about?,3,10,Michael
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?,3,23,Dwight
Isn't that your money?,4,1,Andy
"Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?",3,10,Ryan
"Argh, why are you all...",5,12,Michael
"Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.",3,3,Angela
"Yes, nice. Good word association",8,16,Jim
...kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.,5,14,Michael
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.,6,7,Jim
"I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?",3,20,Andy
"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",6,21,Dwight

What's what?,3,18,Jim
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.,7,14,Michael
You mean me?,9,3,Pam
"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.",8,6,Pam
"Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.",3,15,Phyllis
To look good for Val!,8,9,Darryl
This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.,2,14,Michael
Do you think? Or do you know?,2,13,Dwight
Do we have one?,2,10,Kevin
"Not really, my fiance is out of town.",2,16,Kevin
Okay. Just gotta...,6,17,Jim
Why'd you say dollars?,5,9,Oscar
Clean up on aisle five. [,7,16,Michael

Thank you.,3,16,Pam
The last…,9,23,Jim
Anybody?,3,19,Darryl
And I am always busy.,4,7,Jim
So now you're writing two things?,2,16,Jim
"Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn’t know, you didn’t know, and you didn’t freaking know. But I knew!",9,19,Kevin
That is correct.,3,21,Dwight
Wanna play catch in the parking lot?,9,15,Erin
"Right. There, first...",4,8,Jim
"We did it, we did it. I love you.",9,21,Dwight
"Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.",8,22,Ryan
We had to leave because of creative differences.,8,7,Andy
We're laughing at this cartoon!,5,6,Phyllis
Cause you're sweeter than candy.,2,12,Dwight
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.,5,25,Dwight
I'm just --,4,7,Dwight
OK. Packer can go to hell.,9,17,Phyllis
"Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.",6,4,Michael
Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. One second. Oh...,9,9,Jim
Since Christmas.,2,21,Oscar
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,3,8,Michael
"Yeah. It’s real. It’s the only way you’ll learn. OK, and go ahead. Oh, god, nice! She’s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!",9,22,Jim
Ryan?,3,3,Michael
"Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-",9,22,Dwight
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!,4,5,Michael
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?,1,3,Jim
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.,3,20,Jim
"Jim, please no loopholes.",7,20,Michael
"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",2,10,Jim
"Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",3,4,Pam
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.,6,18,Phyllis
That's not happening.,4,5,Angela
I'm gonna with the python.,5,25,Dwight
"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",3,4,Michael
"Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.",3,3,Michael
Yes! The freaking PDA!,7,15,Oscar
Jim's gonna love it.,3,21,Phyllis
"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him ""Hey! Hey Scott!""",6,20,Michael
You're asking him to give up all of his power.,5,17,Andy
"Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.",9,23,Pam
"No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.",7,5,Oscar
"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",4,2,Michael
"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",2,21,Jim
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!,7,3,Andy
Thank you.,9,22,Pam
Make that face he likes.,7,15,Darryl
You could just be saying it to get the job.,7,24,Jim
We would really appreciate it.,6,4,Jim
"See, now you don’t owe me anything.",9,23,Jim
"You guys, they're making out.",5,13,Andy
"Um. Okay, um.",3,2,Michael
"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.",7,1,Pam
Yes.,7,3,Michael
"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",6,3,Michael
They’re terrible.,8,8,Jim
I mean... I'm impressed.,9,15,Andy
"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?",9,14,Jim
I am. I am the office administrator! Window treatment guy Can I show you a few samples?,7,2,Pam
"I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.",7,24,Phyllis
Are you okay?,3,7,Pam
"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...",1,4,Michael
He's around here somewhere.,9,14,Erin
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?,7,22,Pam
"""Don't be an idiot."" Changed my life.",3,16,Dwight
I'm pretty sure we said slap.,6,8,Michael
Is that what happened to you?,6,17,Jim
"Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!",8,19,Andy
No--- We're all unstable.,3,23,Michael
"Oh, I’m sorry. Didn’t you cheat on Andy?",9,12,Erin
I have a very strong suspicion.,7,24,Oscar
"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.",2,1,Michael
"A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!",8,18,Dwight
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.",8,22,Ryan
"I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.",2,16,Michael
"Good, good. What else?",9,15,Andy
I thought we were having a nice time.,5,16,Pam
We did?,5,10,Michael
"Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?",4,14,Michael
"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",3,8,Michael
"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?",9,23,Jim
Alright.,6,15,Jim
I should really get going.,5,1,Pam
Joe Montana!,4,9,Pam
You took something that doesn't belong to you.,2,7,Dwight
"Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",9,18,Pam
"Irene, what would you do without me?",8,19,Erin
"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.",5,24,Michael
"I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!",5,26,Michael
"Well, I...",5,25,Andy
"Yeah, the fractional ownership property. Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.",8,21,Ryan
"Yeah, she does like Elmo.",8,1,Jim
"Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?",7,19,Angela
She was always engaged.,2,11,Jim
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,4,5,Pam
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.,4,1,Pam
We need a warning signal.,8,1,Kevin
"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",6,20,Jim
"I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.",8,13,Darryl
"Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.",2,1,Pam
You did not just say that! You don’t know Pam. She is really cool.,9,21,Dwight
"No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!",5,3,Dwight
"No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.",5,26,Jim
I think it does.,2,3,Michael
Do you like Steve Miller?,1,6,Kevin
"Not so weak, huh, Mom?",5,3,Dwight
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.,8,15,Dwight
No. Let's talk for a long time.,6,4,Jim
Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--,3,9,Kevin
"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!",2,11,Michael
Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?,8,5,Pam
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.,8,4,Ryan
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.,2,17,Dwight
"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?",8,13,Andy
"Aw, it's gonna be the worst.",5,20,Jim
It's the only gavel I could find.,5,4,Phyllis
How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.,2,4,Michael
Please don't throw garbage at me.,1,5,Pam
Oh the Anti-Christ!,6,12,Michael
"Yeah, wasn't that neat?",9,18,Pam
We already have a sofa. So why do---,4,4,Michael
"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one...",4,10,Pam
"Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.",5,5,Dwight
Long johns? A shaw?,3,19,Kevin
"Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?",3,1,Michael
Okay. Phyllis.,2,4,Jim
I saw that. That's great!,9,14,Dwight
I can hear you.,7,15,Darryl
"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.",6,3,Jim
Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.,6,16,Michael
Okay.,4,4,Michael
"No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael.",3,19,Dwight
Please stop that!,6,17,Jim
It's firm.,5,22,Dwight
"Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",5,25,Jim
"Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.",2,14,Michael
"Yeah, I know.",2,11,Jim
And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?,5,7,Jim
"Hey, I didn’t get a chance to say it, but… congratulations, Dwight.",9,21,Oscar
All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?,1,1,Michael
"Okay, now I'm laughing at you.",2,1,Pam
"Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.",3,12,Andy
"Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...",3,22,Pam
"Kevin, stop it with that question.",9,2,Angela
"Oh, come on.",5,6,Michael
"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?",2,12,Michael
Oy vey... schmear.,2,16,Michael
Oh yeah.,1,4,Jim
Right. But how'd you say it?,7,13,Pam
Yup.,3,20,Jim
"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?",5,21,Dwight
"Don't be mad, it is a business trip.",3,2,Dwight
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,4,10,Dwight
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. Here we go.,5,13,Dwight
"What do we got? Creed, disqualified.",6,19,Michael
"Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you’re not the best with the phone.",9,12,Jim
"Too late, Kev.",1,6,Jim
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.,9,12,Kevin
Time's almost up. How many are left?,8,21,Oscar
What was that?,8,10,Jim
"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",1,1,Michael
"I think you do, mon.",1,2,Kevin
"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",9,15,Jim
"I think I’m a little too busy these days to s--- Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.",9,12,Jim
"Yeah, the Syracuse branch can’t be happy you’re taking New York clients.",8,23,Phyllis
You didn't think to mention me huh?,7,20,Pam
Yes!,1,5,Michael
Us.,9,13,Pam
You came into my office voluntarily.,1,3,Dwight
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.,6,4,Dwight
E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?,7,12,Michael
And Bingo was his name. Let's go.,5,24,Michael
“And shove it up my butt.”,8,13,Jim
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?,2,4,Dwight
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!,4,13,Kevin
"Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.",3,21,Dwight
"I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.",4,11,Michael
Andy Bernard.,3,22,Michael
"A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! Who's this guy? Look at him dance. Fail!",9,4,Andy
"Michael, it's Phyllis.",6,15,Dwight
"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",4,5,Michael
"No, that's not it.",5,11,Michael
"Toby, how did we do?",7,1,Andy
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,4,1,Pam
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?,9,2,Phyllis
"Oh, this could be a juicy one.",6,9,Dwight
"Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.",8,19,Erin
I am the guy who roused that crowd.,6,10,Michael
"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?",4,1,Michael
"Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.",1,6,Jim
"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",2,10,Michael
"All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.",5,1,Michael
"For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here...",7,24,Andy
"Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl…",8,16,Erin
Yeah.,3,23,Michael
Okay.,3,8,Michael
"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. I really want it.",4,10,Pam
Mmmm.. suck-ah!,3,7,Andy
That was your choice; don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip.,5,8,Ryan
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.,2,12,Ryan
"If he is your son, that’s a great plan. But he’s not. He’s not your son.",9,22,Angela
"Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.",9,3,Pam
"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.",5,5,Andy
I like the sound of this. Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?,6,21,Darryl
You didn't have to boo him.,7,3,Darryl
"Oh, no, I don't think this is it.",2,17,Dwight
"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",2,21,Dwight
May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... ah! It's working. It's... I knew it!,6,22,Andy
"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...",7,7,Dwight
Stay or...,2,15,Michael
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?,7,19,Dwight
"Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.",3,6,Michael
Nice. Boobs.,5,17,Kevin
"Okay, make a commercial.",4,5,Jim
"Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.",6,6,Jim
Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.,6,14,Michael
I didn't lose my desk.,2,6,Dwight
"Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..",9,4,Jim
"Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.",8,4,Jim
"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...",4,12,Jim
"Hey, check it out. This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.",5,1,Andy
None of your business.,5,6,Dwight
It was like amateur hour.,7,3,Andy
"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.",2,3,Michael
"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.",2,10,Michael
"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",5,20,Jim
Trying to get a head count.,6,19,Andy
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.,7,12,Dwight
"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",3,11,Michael
"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.",1,4,Jim
Sounds neat.,5,22,Pam
"Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers.",5,1,Michael
"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.",3,5,Andy
"It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.",1,2,Pam
"Yeah, okay.",5,4,Jim
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.,5,17,Kevin
Pick it up.,7,15,Darryl
"No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da na na na na.",5,5,Darryl
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.,2,10,Angela
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,2,11,Pam
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments.,5,12,Andy
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.,2,3,Angela
Stop.,7,7,Jim
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.,7,15,Erin
"Hey!  Look sharp!  Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute.",3,20,Dwight
Good stuff. Nice stuff.  Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.,9,6,Andy
"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?",6,21,Andy
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.,4,10,Pam
"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",8,8,Dwight
That's what she said.,4,8,Michael
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?,3,19,Darryl
"I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.",4,4,Michael
What are you going to do with your time off?,2,7,Pam
Is that all you have on her?,6,4,Michael
"I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.",3,14,Michael
"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",6,10,Jim
"You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!",9,5,Angela
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.,9,17,Kevin
No.,4,9,Michael
"Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So...",3,14,Jim
"It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.",4,6,Michael
"Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.",3,2,Pam
Jerk.,7,4,Michael
"So, umm, is this your first office job then?",7,22,Pam
"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.",5,8,Pam
"I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.",2,14,Pam
"No, it's, that's respectable.",3,5,Pam
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.,2,3,Dwight
"And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!",2,1,Pam
My nanny used to wear that.,7,8,Andy
Really.,3,14,Michael
I love you so much.,8,1,Pam
"Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.",8,11,Jim
"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.",6,9,Michael
White.,7,10,Pam
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?,9,6,Angela
It was hilarious.,6,9,Andy
"People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?",6,1,Dwight
Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you.,4,7,Jim
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.,5,15,Michael
... proud.,4,14,Michael
As has Angela!,7,15,Dwight
"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",4,1,Michael
"I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.",8,3,Darryl
Then I want my big blue sweater back.,9,16,Andy
That there's a woman's suit.,3,18,Darryl
"Uh, sure.",3,23,Pam
Did you check the vending machine?,3,4,Andy
"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?",9,10,Pam
You put a note in my food?,5,19,Oscar
Woah.,2,16,Kevin
"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what?

"Nope, I got eel.",3,6,Jim
"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.",4,7,Dwight
"It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",4,12,Ryan
"Yeah, who wrote it?",7,14,Phyllis
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...,3,23,Oscar

"Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us. Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.  I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?",5,16,Michael
It was playful hazing.,4,14,Dwight

We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,2,10,Dwight
"No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.",3,18,Michael
How is that funny?,7,3,Michael

"Pam, you make more copies than anyone.",5,9,Oscar
"Michael, I...",1,5,Dwight
"Stanley, you're dancing!",4,3,Phyllis
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-,8,7,Dwight
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.,5,9,Angela
Great.,3,12,Pam
"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",2,10,Michael

I am going to give Toby...,4,14,Michael
That's awesome.,7,22,Jim

"Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry.  Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?",5,3,Michael
Look at that. Perfectly balanced. This is a fine precision instrument.,4,7,Dwight

"Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.",2,10,Oscar
Nuh uh.,8,6,Oscar
Fence with a hole in it..,7,4,Dwight

Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.,8,4,Angela
"Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?",5,9,Oscar

Bye Michael! Yeah!,5,26,Dwight

"Hey, smooth guys.",6,4,Pam
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?,3,15,Michael
You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,5,24,Jim

I remember.Mr.,1,2,Kevin
Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---,3,20,Dwight
"It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?",5,8,Ryan

I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. Michael and,2,18,Pam
"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.",3,11,Michael
"OK, good.",5,3,Michael

"Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",6,22,Jim
Because we could get some food...,4,4,Andy
"Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we’re talking about is…basically the speech equivalent… to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use…but need need for talk talk.",8,2,Andy
"Meredith, your boob is out.",5,24,Oscar
"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.",8,22,Oscar

Yeah. Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,2,11,Jim
Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.,5,2,Jim
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?,3,22,Pam
"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael. Wendy's phone operator This isn't Wendy.",4,10,Michael
That’s a license number?,9,7,Pam
"There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",7,11,Michael
"Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?",2,4,Michael
"I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?",5,3,Michael
Awww!,6,12,Dwight
We're party girls.,5,10,Michael
"Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.",5,12,Kevin
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.,5,5,Michael
I have to see these shoes.,8,20,Dwight
Summing up.,3,19,Darryl
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!,8,22,Kevin
It’s a photocopy from your notebook.,8,1,Andy
"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.",3,9,Dwight
"I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.",4,10,Pam
Does David know this?,5,18,Michael
"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.",4,11,Michael
"Why don’t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.",8,17,Andy
T-Dog?,8,2,Ryan
Yes.,2,21,Michael
Like Angela in accounting.,4,2,Dwight
"Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?",4,14,Michael
Good. Good. Good!De,7,20,Michael
Has that ever happened? Ever?,6,19,Darryl
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?,8,21,Darryl
"No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.",3,22,Dwight
"No, no. Not even.",8,7,Oscar
Okay.,4,14,Michael
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.,8,4,Dwight
You haven’t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let’s go over membership. I’m going to need the first month’s and the last month’s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month…,8,9,Dwight
"Umm, nacho chips.",5,17,Michael
"No, this little guy is mine.",9,23,Ryan
What are you doing? What are you doing?,6,20,Michael
"Dwight, could you move over a little bit.",4,6,Michael
That never happened. He’s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught “saving treats” from the kitty litter box.,9,11,Dwight
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,7,6,Jim
You don't say?,8,21,Darryl
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.,7,9,Dwight
Go away.,2,6,Michael
"Wow, this is tough.",3,3,Michael
Umm... I'm number three.,3,10,Andy
Why did you just say he was the boss?,7,8,Michael
It’s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.,9,8,Pam
Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?,3,10,Dwight
"Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.",2,22,Michael
Mmm-hmm.,6,7,Jim
"Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.",3,20,Michael
Why?,2,5,Michael
"Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.",3,12,Michael
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,6,5,Pam
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.,2,6,Michael
He's always been terrible with money.,4,4,Phyllis
42897. Ok.,2,7,Michael
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.,1,2,Pam
"I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.",5,24,Michael
"Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.",2,22,Darryl
With the crotch.,8,7,Dwight
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? Meredith?,6,7,Michael
"Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!",7,23,Dwight
"Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday?",5,16,Pam
What the hell are you reading to them?,2,18,Michael
"Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?",4,4,Michael
"Yes, this is too tan. This right here-",8,18,Erin
"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",7,11,Michael
Hee-heeding this right now.,5,13,Dwight
YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.,8,8,Dwight
"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn’t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, “Where were you when the girls came?”",8,17,Andy
"Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.",3,19,Michael
"Thank you, Dwight.",6,4,Pam
"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.",7,7,Pam
You look awesome.,8,3,Andy
"I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.",7,3,Andy
"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.",6,13,Michael
You are bleeding through your shirt.,8,15,Jim
"I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.",7,4,Michael
"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",4,1,Dwight
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.,5,25,Phyllis
"Hey, any fun weekend plans?",6,14,Andy
"Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.",6,16,Andy
"You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...",7,13,Michael
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.,3,19,Andy
Oh,3,12,Jim
"Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!",9,21,Andy
You should go to Hedonism.,2,17,Kevin
"Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...",3,7,Michael
"Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.",9,9,Pam
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!,6,1,Andy
That's her private property.,9,16,Oscar
Not again.,6,10,Oscar
"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",7,5,Michael
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.,8,19,Dwight
"Stop ordering me around, Jim!",9,4,Dwight
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.,1,2,Dwight
Oscar. Angela.,3,17,Kevin
"Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.",4,6,Andy
Esther Ruger.,9,18,Dwight
"No, I wouldn’t. I can’t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I’d like to try.",9,8,Pam
"Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.",1,6,Jim
He’ll know that we looked at his private notebook.,8,1,Andy
"I didn't think you'd notice. Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.",5,18,Jim
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.,2,22,Michael
"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!",4,1,Michael
But you're leaving...,5,11,Jim
"Michael, I... I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?",7,9,Pam
"No. I said I hate the, the style.",4,5,Michael
"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",4,1,Pam
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.,8,21,Phyllis
"Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.",9,9,Dwight
How do you know it was me?,1,1,Jim
"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.",6,17,Michael
"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",4,5,Michael
"Hey kids, was that fun?",7,9,Dwight
"I will never, ever let you down.",9,21,Dwight
I can't tell if he's mocking me.,4,3,Andy
Hi!,5,5,Pam
It tells me nothing.,3,22,Pam
I think I should go the hospital.,7,23,Andy
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.  I'm confiscating this.,5,24,Dwight
Get in!,5,6,Dwight
"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",8,6,Andy
You snubbed her.,7,5,Dwight
"Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?",3,22,Pam
I don’t need your help.,8,23,Dwight
"Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.",7,10,Pam
"I'm gonna grab her, okay.",8,13,Jim
"Hey, Hey Robert!",9,18,Oscar
Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!,9,3,Erin
It all happened so fast.,4,1,Pam
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.,2,11,Oscar
Andy's afwaid?,5,25,Michael
"Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.",2,6,Dwight
"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",5,5,Jim
Definitely.,9,2,Jim
"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.",2,6,Jim
It could totally work though. I don’t know why we wouldn’t. Oh my god are we doing this?,9,5,Andy
"Well, I'm neither of those things, so...",7,5,Jim
"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!",7,17,Jim
Get in the car?,7,20,Jim
"Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",2,16,Jim
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.,9,21,Oscar
"Wait, why are you limping?",6,8,Dwight
You talking to me?,5,13,Michael
It wasn't. I swear.,2,1,Pam
"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",2,22,Michael
It's from James Bond.,5,12,Michael
When's the contest?,3,22,Pam
"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.",8,18,Dwight
Then I'll make you.,5,11,Andy
"Kevin, you're such a gourmand.",6,16,Pam
That's too funny.,6,12,Oscar
Smell that. Do you smell that?,4,2,Michael
That look?,1,5,Michael
"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?",2,19,Dwight
You my friend are in a very close second.,4,3,Andy
"Um, yeah, that would be great.",6,16,Pam
"Yeah, he is.",4,2,Pam
Surprise!  Everybody!,2,9,Dwight
Open QuickTime.,6,7,Kevin
"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?",3,10,Dwight
"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He’s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I’m hesitant. Why can’t I pull the trigger on any of them?",9,13,Dwight
"Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.",7,13,Andy
I'll stay for ten.,1,4,Dwight
"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",1,3,Michael
"You should stop this, and you should call Dwight right now.",6,22,Jim
You’re just saying that to make me feel better.,9,23,Kevin
"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.",6,23,Michael
"Well it sounds right, but is it?",4,4,Michael
We'll see.,6,4,Dwight
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.,8,16,Pam
"I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, ""What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?"" Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.",2,21,Michael
So is this the meeting you've been in all day?,5,18,Michael
That's my office. &nbspDeleted Scene 4&nbsp,2,15,Darryl
No one said it has no calories.,3,21,Pam
Oh you?,9,18,Oscar
"Well, thanks. I appreciate that.",3,8,Kevin
Hey.,3,9,Jim
You dressed exactly like the servants.,3,17,Dwight
"I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.",7,5,Michael
I’ll take a look.,8,9,Darryl
Just do it.,6,5,Andy
What do we got?,9,22,Jim
I have my passport.,5,7,Michael
"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",2,8,Michael
"Oh, baloney.",6,19,Andy
"Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why… Toby is giving us self defense training.",8,17,Andy
Hey Kevin... That's really funny.,5,1,Ryan
Sure.,2,8,Pam
"Oh, the wires need insulation. It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.",9,4,Dwight
Give me the pointer.,7,1,Michael
"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",2,3,Michael
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.,6,23,Michael
"This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, just a couple of kittens out on the town.",4,1,Angela
"You gonna answer that, Kev?",5,20,Jim
Is--do the people--,5,24,Erin
"You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.",2,18,Michael
"Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-",7,5,Andy
I'm... discombobulated.,4,4,Dwight
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?,7,20,Pam
I might.,6,8,Michael
"So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's?  Go to Bernie's?",2,9,Michael
Later man.,4,2,Andy
It's not really 1992 anymore.,6,15,Dwight
"Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.",8,4,Pam
And your veil.,3,2,Dwight
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.,4,14,Michael
"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",1,4,Jim
"Oh, come on. Come on.",2,22,Michael
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!,9,10,Erin
"Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?",7,2,Pam
Is there something that you would like to say to me?,6,24,Michael
Are you sure you don’t want me to drop him off?,9,22,Angela
She strong?,6,8,Michael
"Well, I like to swim.",5,25,Erin
Oh! “Fix” means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!,8,17,Ryan
Great. See ya' then.,6,7,Jim
Fifty.,2,10,Angela
"Stanley and I are close, too.",2,21,Phyllis
What did you do? Huh?,5,15,Dwight
"What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.",8,22,Andy
"This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.",9,2,Erin
"No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.",9,9,Dwight
"And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.",3,20,Michael
"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",6,3,Michael
"But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.",8,24,Erin
"Well, maybe you'll meet someone.",7,12,Pam
Are you kidding me? Stop it.,7,7,Michael
One other thing I wanted to...,4,13,Michael
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?,6,20,Michael
Was she talkin' back?,4,1,Dwight
Good. Excellent. Thank you.,6,1,Dwight
"Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the ""F"" word?",7,2,Andy
"Yep, get it.",4,6,Michael
"Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.",3,18,Michael
"Dammit, Phyllis!",3,15,Dwight
I quit.,5,18,Michael
"Later, Kev. Have a good weekend.",2,6,Jim
What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day.,7,13,Michael
"Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?",7,8,Angela
"Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.",3,14,Michael
Let’s call him.,9,12,Pam
"Hold it, hold it. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?",7,5,Michael
Can I have a raise?,3,18,Jim
Just… so weird.,9,2,Jim
"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",2,8,Michael
"Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.",9,14,Erin
That's your new standard.,7,10,Darryl
"If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.",9,22,Darryl
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?,7,14,Jim
Oh do you mean when I get the job?,3,23,Jim
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,8,6,Dwight
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?,5,15,Oscar
"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.",7,23,Andy
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?,8,8,Andy
"Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.",8,16,Dwight
Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.,5,7,Ryan
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.,2,3,Angela
"What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.",7,3,Pam
Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.,3,4,Michael
"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",2,11,Michael
I wasn't telling you.,6,4,Andy
"Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.",6,7,Phyllis
But we don't keep two sets of books.,2,5,Angela
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.,3,19,Jim
"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.",6,21,Dwight
I wouldn't enjoy that.,7,5,Darryl
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!,9,21,Dwight
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .,2,19,Michael
What's that?,3,20,Jim
I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.,5,8,Michael
Wow.,4,8,Jim
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.,6,16,Andy
"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",6,21,Dwight
Let’s go outside,9,23,Jim
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.,2,3,Ryan
"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.",4,8,Michael
"I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?",5,6,Dwight
Clark's a dead man.,9,20,Erin
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.,5,14,Pam
Yeah. Um line 1?,8,7,Andy
"We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.",4,12,Jim
"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.",7,2,Michael
I have it on good authority that you said the following.  Can you read that back to me?,6,11,Michael
"That's a total waste of your ""M.""",2,8,Dwight
Kevin.,6,7,Oscar
"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.",5,13,Michael
"Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work .",6,16,Dwight
It was all my fault.,9,14,Angela
"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.",5,6,Michael
"Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.",9,22,Angela
It's hard.,2,8,Angela
"Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.",7,22,Pam
"Mmm, whatcha got?",7,19,Phyllis
Stop,2,12,Jim
"Kevin! Damnit Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -",6,18,Dwight
"Come on, the Three Amigos.",8,5,Kevin
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?,1,1,Pam
Packer. Pac-man.,1,5,Michael
"Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.",8,16,Ryan
"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.",9,12,Pam
"Actually, you didn't.",6,19,Jim
No. Call Bob.,5,25,Phyllis
Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.,7,22,Pam
"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right?",2,6,Jim
"When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?",3,18,Dwight
"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.",6,6,Jim
"It says “Lotto Pool”, right on top.",8,3,Pam
No. Was that the hard way?,1,3,Jim
It's been a rough couple of weeks.,4,9,Michael
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?,7,14,Jim
Take them at the same time.,3,19,Darryl
"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.",5,15,Jim
"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.",6,18,Michael
I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...,3,10,Kevin
It's not ready yet.,5,17,Michael
"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?",7,3,Andy
I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating.,4,10,Jim
"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. No, no, meeting's not over.",6,18,Michael
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.,6,20,Pam
Yeah. It's really ugly,9,3,Pam
"Angela, it’s a lead freaking pipe.",9,8,Oscar
"Uh, fine. What's up?",2,4,Ryan
Are you holding this chair?,8,17,Ryan
"Been there, done that.",5,23,Dwight
"I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! Whoa, hey!",3,16,Michael
No!,7,17,Michael
"You're a saint, Pam.",9,10,Oscar
Darryl is dating Val... still.,9,12,Darryl
"Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.",3,19,Michael
"Um, I'll... I have to think about it.",4,14,Michael
"No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!",6,16,Dwight
"Oh, are you firing Creed?",2,5,Jim
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?,3,13,Dwight
"God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?",6,23,Dwight
Boy I---,3,18,Jim
And you are…,8,23,Dwight
"Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?",5,5,Darryl
I know that. Don't you think I know that?,2,20,Dwight
"Dwight, run!",5,22,Michael
You did?,6,4,Michael
"Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.",4,2,Dwight
"Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met.",6,18,Andy
"Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.",7,14,Jim
"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, ""Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.""",2,10,Michael
You might take something.,4,14,Michael
Where you from?,5,19,Michael
"You know, we’ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we’re in this weird dance….",8,2,Andy
"Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",6,11,Jim
"How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",6,6,Pam
"No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.",2,4,Michael
Is that what 'soon' means to you?,5,19,Pam
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.,3,17,Ryan
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.,8,9,Darryl
The glasses are a little...,7,2,Ryan
Stop. What?,5,11,Jim
James Bond was a spy.,9,17,Kevin
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,2,20,Dwight
"Yeah, it'll be you.",1,1,Kevin
Good. That is great to hear.,4,8,Ryan
"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.",8,13,Dwight
"Okay. Aw, thank you.",6,16,Pam
Super romantic.,6,22,Andy
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",1,3,Michael
"He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.",3,10,Michael
"Yeah, I know.Ad guy 1 Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?",4,5,Michael
Good stuff. All right.  Let's get down to some wine drinking.,4,9,Michael
"This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!",6,19,Andy
It's not like you can fire people or anything.,6,10,Phyllis
Hey!,3,8,Jim
Hmm…Heda. No.,8,6,Jim
And it didn't change your mind.,6,23,Phyllis
You guys should use a hand truck.,2,10,Dwight
I am clicking.,7,14,Phyllis
Come here please.,2,12,Michael
"He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.",7,17,Kevin
"Oh God, Rabies?",4,1,Michael
He does.Pam's mom Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.,6,4,Pam
Or you're dead.,7,6,Kevin
"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?",2,2,Michael
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.,1,3,Oscar
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?,9,5,Dwight
I'm doing something over here.,6,12,Ryan
Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,2,20,Dwight
"Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",1,5,Michael
"Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.",3,11,Michael
"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",6,2,Michael
Ah damn pop-ups.,3,1,Dwight
"No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.",7,12,Darryl
Whoa.,9,15,Kevin
"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.",8,9,Jim
Fish sounds great.,9,15,Erin
"No, I will not.",3,13,Pam
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.,4,1,Jim
No. Humans with AIDS.,2,22,Michael
"Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.",6,19,Andy
"Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.",6,4,Andy
"Monkey see, monkey do.",6,9,Michael
Like hypothetically… if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.,9,3,Jim
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,6,21,Michael
Don't interrupt.,4,14,Ryan
Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?,5,14,Jim
Yes! I'm in.,7,22,Andy
Right. I'm sorry.,5,25,Erin
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?,8,13,Darryl
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-,8,13,Andy
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.,6,10,Michael
I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.,5,11,Angela
I can’t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.,9,8,Dwight
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.,5,25,Phyllis
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!,6,21,Michael
That's really not cool.,5,8,Jim
"Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?",1,6,Michael
"Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!",8,1,Andy
"I think I know what's going on. Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now. And there isn't. But, um... don't tell him. Don't tell him that. I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.",4,2,Michael
"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",4,2,Michael
"Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...",9,15,Oscar
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.,2,4,Jim
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.,8,8,Pam
"Oh, don't worry about it.",7,5,Darryl
Oh no.,5,18,Pam
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.,3,17,Dwight
"Oh, I bet you like it.",6,1,Kevin
Brought it in here-,2,7,Dwight
No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.,6,16,Jim
"Michael, wait. Let me go.",4,2,Dwight
"I'm about to buy this building, you know.",6,24,Dwight
"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",6,5,Dwight
"And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",3,22,Jim
"And for—oh, whoopsie daisy. Mrs.",9,19,Dwight
Observe.,6,8,Dwight
No... sport.,6,24,Jim
You're useless.,3,18,Angela
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.,3,12,Phyllis
That's not a joke.,7,12,Michael
"I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.",3,23,Michael
"Really, you can’t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he’s basically Gumby with hair.",9,11,Pam
No way.,2,7,Jim
"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?",5,25,Erin
Really?,6,18,Michael
"Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?",3,21,Kevin
The dream team... and Meredith.,7,21,Angela
Conference room?,4,7,Pam
"The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.",5,21,Andy
"Look, we want you back.Ex-client Can you offer lower prices?",4,2,Michael
"Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!",8,16,Pam
It was an accident.,4,1,Michael
Amen.,3,4,Angela
Merry Christmas. Good.,6,12,Dwight
"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",9,15,Jim
"Hello, everyone.",2,11,Michael
And I have started a business in Philadelphia.,9,16,Jim
"You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",6,21,Michael
"Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.",2,19,Jim
"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",6,6,Pam
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?,9,16,Angela
"Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?",3,2,Michael
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.,8,18,Dwight
"Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.",1,5,Michael
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.,4,1,Michael
I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.,6,5,Andy
All right. I can do that. Then what?,7,5,Oscar
"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",2,3,Michael
"Why? Well, theft and stealing.",1,1,Michael
Then I will name your team the Red team.,3,22,Michael
"Yeah. I think maybe I want a ""wedding"" wedding.",5,25,Pam
So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.,5,19,Michael
"Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.",9,20,Dwight
I'm not done yet.,5,16,Oscar
"Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-",3,14,Dwight
"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.",7,24,Dwight
"Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.",2,6,Michael
A hunter.,3,5,Dwight
"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky.",4,7,Michael
I didn't... I didn't think you needed them for this part.,3,19,Dwight
I don’t think so.,9,21,Kevin
"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",6,9,Michael
Hm-hmm.,8,22,Pam
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.,3,8,Jim
Wow. Really terrific.,6,14,Michael
"I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.",9,16,Pam
Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.,6,4,Andy
Probably went to his head.,4,7,Oscar
Hey! High-five!,8,12,Andy
"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",6,3,Michael
I think many people find that character slightly racist.,2,1,Oscar
It was nothing personal. It’s just that you were terrible at your job.,9,23,Dwight
I think Stanley just coughed.,2,9,Jim
"Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.",9,9,Dwight
Cmon.,5,12,Dwight
What do you think you're doing?,8,9,Dwight
I'm busy.,2,6,Dwight
It has my face on it.,5,6,Andy
You're 'I need you to' is my command.,5,19,Michael
So happy right now.,9,9,Jim
"No, but maybe the reason…",9,23,Kevin
"Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",5,8,Jim
Ding dong.,5,17,Jim
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.,4,12,Jim
"Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.",9,5,Andy
Read the pros first.,3,21,Pam
"Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.",6,4,Erin
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!,6,6,Erin
"I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?",3,22,Pam
"My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?",8,4,Dwight
"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",2,11,Michael
"No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.",4,1,Angela
You said she liked me.,6,16,Kevin
He's in a box?,1,4,Pam
Done.,1,4,Dwight
Let me get that door for you--,6,8,Dwight
It's clearly not an accounting mistake.,9,6,Oscar
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,7,1,Michael
"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",7,5,Michael
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.,5,2,Pam
"Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style.",5,24,Ryan
"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",6,15,Andy
"Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.",4,11,Jim
"We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.",5,14,Andy
"Hey, Pam! How are you?",9,23,Darryl
Who eats eight protein bars?,6,22,Michael
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.,6,20,Dwight
Do you run the bed and breakfest?,4,4,Jim
"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.",9,21,Jim
"Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.",4,14,Jim
What was Oprah about?,3,2,Pam
"Wow, it smells really good too.",6,15,Erin
"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",1,1,Jim
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.,4,4,Michael
"Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.",2,10,Pam
"Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!",7,8,Michael
"Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.",1,6,Ryan
Thank you. Whatcha got there?,7,18,Ryan
"And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.",2,2,Michael
I smell mold.,2,3,Dwight
Ah. Your eminence.,6,10,Michael
Right here. Little Michael Scott-,8,1,Pam
"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",7,15,Pam
"Okay, what's next?",5,13,Dwight
It's about this very announcement you just made.,7,5,Dwight
Congratulations.,7,16,Michael
"Yeah, you know, like guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh… guh.",9,2,Erin
"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!",8,17,Dwight
"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.",6,16,Pam
"Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?",4,12,Michael
Weapons.,8,17,Pam
"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.",6,7,Michael
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,1,4,Michael
"A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",2,11,Michael
"Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?",6,5,Oscar
Let's get back to work.,3,4,Dwight
"Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.",8,3,Andy
"Well, they can’t all be winners. But Trevor’s next and he’s a real professional. You say, “Jump,” and he says, “Oh who?” He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",9,13,Dwight
"Alright, so, teams forming.",5,9,Michael
Joint custody,6,23,Angela
"Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!",8,18,Dwight
"Eleven, wow!",6,19,Phyllis
Just sit down Kelly.,2,1,Michael
Rrahh!,8,18,Dwight
What are you saying?,3,22,Dwight
"Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...",2,17,Michael
"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect.",2,8,Pam
Parkour!,6,1,Andy
Mm-wah!,5,1,Andy
the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..,3,6,Jim
"Um, what about you?",7,13,Dwight
"Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.",7,21,Jim
"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.",5,18,Jim
In juvie.,5,15,Dwight
"Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...",3,10,Dwight
"Tube City, you owe me one.",6,9,Michael
"Actually, it was.",7,10,Ryan
"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.",6,9,Andy
"Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.",9,9,Jim
"I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.",1,6,Jim
"Dwight, I asked him.",4,11,Michael
I know just the man for the job.,9,14,Dwight
Aah!,5,11,Dwight
"My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.",5,5,Michael
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.,3,10,Andy
That'd be great.,4,2,Pam
Your foot?,2,12,Dwight
"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.",8,18,Dwight
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 614 PM. 614!,5,4,Dwight
"No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.",5,21,Michael
"No, there’s wine in here.",9,8,Phyllis
"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.",5,21,Michael
You’re back?,9,23,Oscar
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.,7,2,Andy
Yeah.,7,21,Michael
Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.,6,4,Dwight
Manure. Get rid of it.,5,9,Angela
The Beets Motel.,4,4,Pam
You're an idiot.,8,12,Dwight
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.,2,20,Dwight
Meredith!,9,18,Oscar
You don't have anything you're doing?,1,3,Pam
"Hey, do you need a lozenge?",7,13,Andy
Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.,6,7,Andy
"Still said it, so...",3,20,Oscar
"No no, you can go home. I'm good.",4,5,Pam
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.,9,12,Darryl
Uh...,2,4,Michael
No. And the sheets are made of fire.,3,23,Dwight
That's... they always give an ultimatum.,3,20,Michael
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,4,7,Michael
We can go.,1,2,Jim
Have you seen this?,8,2,Angela
"I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.",6,9,Erin
"Bullets are flying everywhere. Ooo, wait, last page, big finish. Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.",2,7,Jim
"Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.",7,13,Andy
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,5,9,Michael
"Well, you like that.",7,9,Pam
"New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let’s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let’s go.",9,19,Dwight
"Oh, lazy. Uh huh.",2,1,Michael
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?,2,13,Michael
Okay. Have fun with your girlfriend!,4,6,Pam
"No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add ""find office""...",5,20,Pam
"All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.",5,5,Michael
Oh me too.,4,1,Pam
Nine first.,7,23,Darryl
"Okay, all right.",2,22,Michael
Look what he's doing.,5,20,Michael
"Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!",9,19,Erin
Who's the senator?,7,12,Oscar
"That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",2,17,Michael
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.,6,5,Andy
"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",6,24,Michael
Yeah. I think you should call social services.,8,2,Pam
"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer.",7,17,Andy
"Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? ""Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?"" ""Jell-O pudding."" Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.",2,17,Michael
"I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but...",1,1,Dwight
"Yeah, it's just a picnic.",8,4,Phyllis
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!,3,4,Angela
I thought we had that looked at.,4,7,Jim
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--,5,24,Andy
Well...,2,8,Michael
"Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.Andy, Creed, Kevin,",4,5,Darryl
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.,6,14,Jim
Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?,5,19,Dwight
Not it. I don't have eggs.,3,22,Michael
"No! No, I’m interested. I mean I think everybody’s interested in why they have to sing it.",9,5,Pam
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?,8,6,Jim
"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",6,24,Michael
You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.,6,1,Michael
Holy crap.,6,8,Phyllis
"Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..",2,10,Oscar
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,3,21,Michael
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool.,5,16,Kevin
"Well, I am starting it again!",6,19,Michael
"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.  Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.",5,8,Michael
"Well, at least you're still being honest with me.",5,21,Michael
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!,3,11,Andy
"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.",7,14,Dwight
"Darryl, it doesn’t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.",9,14,Jim
Jim talked too much.,7,5,Dwight
"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",2,10,Dwight
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.,8,8,Andy
It's not on your desk.,1,1,Jim
"Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear.",9,5,Dwight
"Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.",4,11,Michael
I'd like to make a wish.,6,12,Michael
"Good. N-no no no, don't.",5,8,Michael
"I... uh, well, I don't know.",3,21,Michael
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.,5,21,Dwight
I meant to say something earlier. I just...,9,10,Pam
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.,2,18,Michael
"This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. """,2,8,Dwight
"Oh, yeah right.",1,5,Michael
"Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch ""Lazy Scranton"".",3,8,Michael
"Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.",9,18,Jim
"We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?",4,4,Dwight
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,6,21,Dwight
"You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says ""free play.""",6,5,Erin
Still no plan.,6,22,Darryl
Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.,5,23,Michael
Could he help us with some parking tickets?,7,11,Michael
"You guys are stripes, I think...",6,19,Pam
Alright.,7,21,Jim
Might get ugly.,5,11,Dwight
"OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.",3,22,Dwight
"Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?",2,18,Michael
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?,3,15,Jim
I owe you an apology.,4,4,Michael
"Welcome to the warehouse.Group chant Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...",2,15,Darryl
That we're having any problem at all.,5,23,Ryan
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,7,18,Pam
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.,8,22,Pam
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.,6,7,Pam
Deep fried Twinkies? It's gross!,4,14,Angela
"Umm, what happened?",2,13,Jim
"No, it really seems like something Michael would do.",7,11,Angela
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",1,3,Pam
"Well, okay...",4,14,Michael
Horse Boat.,5,17,Dwight
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.,2,4,Angela
"OK, don't fire me.",8,3,Darryl
"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?",5,25,Dwight
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.,3,10,Dwight
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.,6,3,Dwight
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. Don't be a wuss.,6,10,Andy
"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.  We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?",2,8,Michael
They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash’. That song obviously glorifies the occult.,9,5,Angela
"Okay, yeah.",2,8,Michael
"I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.",9,2,Andy
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.,3,12,Michael
"Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?",9,12,Pam
Yeah? Who did you have?,2,10,Michael
"No, I insist.",6,8,Andy
"Yes, I am. Are you?",7,8,Michael
"I'm not gonna lie to her, either.",8,5,Pam
Can you breathe?,4,12,Dwight
"Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won’t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight",9,1,Angela
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?,4,2,Ryan
"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.",3,2,Michael
"Ok, so is that my spot?",9,20,Pam
Who's gonna see us?,7,20,Jim
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.,4,8,Michael
What is that?,1,1,Michael
"And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.",3,20,Michael
"Are we idiots? What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!",6,3,Dwight
What?,6,15,Michael
Get in there!,6,9,Michael
I have work to do.,6,23,Michael
Oh my god. That's less romantic.,9,15,Jim
Nobody thanked me.,5,18,Michael
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.,9,18,Angela
What does a bean mean?,6,3,Kevin
Oh. Meh.,5,16,Dwight
She's stuck on that one thing.,7,13,Oscar
I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!,4,4,Michael
"Thanks, Brian.",9,14,Pam
Hey D.,4,1,Angela
"No, thanks.",9,13,Jim
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.,8,1,Pam
"Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...",7,24,Ryan
Nice catch.,8,1,Dwight
"And, well, I don't see my co-workers--",5,13,Dwight
Dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.,8,8,Oscar
"Pam, really? Come on.",9,10,Oscar
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.,3,17,Michael
Hey. Morning.,2,3,Pam
"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.",8,21,Pam
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?,7,5,Jim
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.,2,22,Pam
"Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.",8,5,Erin
That is just so disgusting!,4,6,Michael
By wanting it more. By working hard-,5,20,Michael
"Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-",8,12,Andy
"Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?",9,3,Pam
Nice to see you. May I hold him?,8,24,Dwight
I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.,5,2,Michael
Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?,6,1,Andy
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?,6,16,Andy
"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",7,1,Pam
Don't.,5,6,Jim
"Well, how do you like these apples? Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? Guy at table Is he your boyfriend or something?",5,7,Andy
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,1,3,Pam
"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",1,1,Michael
"I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.",5,4,Dwight
"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...",3,12,Dwight
"Hey, hey!",2,21,Michael
"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",6,3,Michael
"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.",3,5,Michael
What? Really? That stinks!,7,8,Michael
"Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!",8,3,Dwight
"I'm going to put everything in terms of ""real dollars"".",3,5,Ryan
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na’ for your entire meeting.,9,7,Phyllis
Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.,4,3,Michael
Do you want me off the call too Michael?,6,12,Erin
Oh! Mother ******!,5,25,Phyllis
"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",4,12,Michael
"A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.",3,16,Michael
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?,5,5,Darryl
"I drove my car into a lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.",4,2,Michael
Go. Get the door.,2,10,Dwight
"Hey, what’s goin’ on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young’uns?",9,22,Andy
"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!",7,20,Michael
And.,3,6,Michael
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.,7,23,Dwight
"Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.",7,18,Oscar
"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",7,11,Michael
Let's celebrate.Mr.,1,2,Michael
Michael.,6,4,Pam
"Oh my God! She’s so stunningly tiny! She’s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they’re doing.",9,7,Angela
"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",3,8,Dwight
Second-in-command to Michael.,5,18,Jim
Con-- you look like a nerd.,6,3,Michael
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,6,10,Michael
"Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!",5,11,Andy
How can she make you get back together with her?,3,23,Angela
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.,6,7,Andy
"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.",8,10,Jim
"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.",6,2,Michael
Good. Really really good.,8,2,Dwight
"I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.",9,22,Jim
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.,8,20,Dwight
Hi.Girl at table Hi.,6,19,Andy
"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...",5,17,Michael
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  Let's ride.,7,14,Dwight
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.,3,6,Michael
"Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.",9,9,Jim
I can get you a tutor if you need-,4,8,Ryan
That's a shawl.,2,22,Michael
"You heard me, pack your things.",3,16,Michael
"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",7,24,Dwight
Yeah.De,7,21,Andy
"So how do you want, how should I do it?",9,20,Andy
"Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.",9,22,Pam
We're hoping our interview seals the deal.,6,14,Pam
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?,2,15,Michael
"You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-",7,19,Michael
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.,2,4,Michael
You're a psychopath.,7,11,Jim
"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.",2,6,Pam
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.,4,2,Michael
"Just about everyone in this office is single right now.  Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",5,16,Michael
You're messing with me.,6,6,Jim
It’s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam’s desk huh?,8,7,Pam
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.,5,22,Dwight
Million dollars!,4,8,Michael
"Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.",3,5,Andy
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,7,6,Pam
But the little cars go in the compact spotMichael and,3,8,Dwight
NO!,2,2,Michael
"Mm, good stuff.",3,18,Dwight
No.,5,13,Michael
Are you guys listening to this?,7,15,Oscar
But don't forget you owe me $10.,5,22,Dwight
"Fun, communication, connection.",7,9,Ryan
Phyllis and Robert.,3,15,Jim
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter.,5,26,Kevin
"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.",4,8,Pam
"Well, I’ve changed my mind.",9,21,Angela
Good. All right.,3,9,Michael
"Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.",8,3,Andy
"I looked at you coming around, and I said, “Wintergreen.”",9,13,Jim
"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.",6,2,Dwight
"That's, that is true.",6,13,Michael
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.,3,10,Dwight
And tell him the joke.,2,14,Michael
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. It's go time.,8,24,Andy
"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.",8,19,Andy
"Oh, dear God in heaven.",9,7,Dwight
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.,9,16,Jim
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?,4,13,Michael
"No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.",7,8,Pam
"Oh, Holy Mother of God.",3,6,Jim
"You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.",7,22,Jim
"Well, thats...",4,9,Michael
I don't think that this is---,4,10,Angela
"Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. Totally kidin' guys.",3,19,Andy
"Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya?",5,16,Jim
"Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not... so, your desk is...",3,8,Michael
"No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.",4,14,Angela
Yeah! Toast!,2,11,Michael
My bare hands.,5,11,Andy
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.,6,10,Pam
"No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.",9,21,Kevin
Die. You just... You said it.,2,6,Dwight
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.,7,8,Dwight
Is there a volume knob on that thing?,9,10,Pam
"Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.",7,5,Jim
Which Spice Girl?,8,17,Jim
"Oh, doggie.",3,12,Andy
Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.,2,12,Dwight
What? Wha? You said ten.,2,3,Michael
"No, seriously.",5,18,Michael
I didn't mean me!,1,6,Michael
"So, don't tell.",2,9,Jim
Uhh-mmm,4,4,Dwight
Is Jim coming back.,3,7,Ryan
Hey Toby.,6,20,Pam
"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",2,11,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?",9,9,Dwight
Stop what?,6,22,Jim
"Uh... ""Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?"" Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",2,21,Michael
"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.",7,23,Dwight
"Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.",6,8,Pam
"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",3,2,Pam
"I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.",5,18,Pam
Thank you muchly.,3,13,Andy
"No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.",6,24,Michael
Well that's great.  You're talking about your court ordered community service?,5,1,Jim
Maybe you do. Hi. I’m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It’s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,8,9,Dwight
"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...",3,5,Dwight
"I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? Oh well.",9,4,Erin
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.,9,10,Pam
You didn't decorate it?,6,12,Phyllis
Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left.  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.,5,1,Dwight
"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.",4,9,Jim
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.,7,7,Oscar
Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI.,2,9,Michael
"Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.",7,13,Andy
"Well, sorry I'm late.",5,15,Angela
"So like, missionary...",5,11,Andy
Oh.,1,5,Jim
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.,2,14,Jim
Stop it! Stop it!,5,7,Michael
With all due respect we know what we’re defending against a twelve year old female bully.,8,17,Oscar
"Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.",9,16,Erin
Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.,9,19,Andy
"Uh-huh, yeah. I am.",3,1,Jim
"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around.",6,11,Michael
We bury him?,5,13,Phyllis
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!,3,8,Michael
"You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.",7,12,Andy
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.,5,6,Dwight
"Where did he go, Holly?",7,14,Erin
"Of course, Nathaniel.",6,9,Erin
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.,5,2,Phyllis
Yeah?,6,2,Michael
"Yeah, do you need a hand?",8,6,Pam
"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",3,5,Michael
"Hey, doc? You forgetting something?  Thank you.",4,1,Michael
Can I say...?,7,24,Oscar
"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.",4,6,Dwight
"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.",8,21,Andy
"And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.",3,10,Kevin
"Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...",6,12,Kevin
"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",6,17,Dwight
"And now, presenting...",5,26,Michael
"You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.",7,9,Angela
"I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.",2,14,Michael
Wow.,3,6,Jim
What kind of mortgage did you get?,2,3,Dwight
"Oh, we will. Have a seat.",6,13,Dwight
"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",7,2,Pam
"I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.",2,7,Michael
"No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.",6,16,Michael
Come here. Come here.,6,21,Dwight
"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.",3,5,Dwight
"Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?",1,6,Michael
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.,6,3,Erin
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.,2,3,Dwight
Yeah.,5,1,Michael
You couldn't of memorized that?,5,13,Jim
I have a copy of your key.,2,8,Dwight
"Pam, come on. ""I like your food."" Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.",1,2,Michael
Dwight! Why?,8,7,Jim
I’ll take him.,9,1,Kevin
"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",7,11,Michael
"That was the sick one, right?",4,1,Dwight
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...,6,7,Jim
Gosh. He he.,6,21,Dwight
"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?",5,22,Andy
"OK, I like your food.",1,2,Pam
"Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.",3,17,Pam
"Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.",7,10,Pam
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.,1,2,Dwight
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?,7,8,Andy
"Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?",2,5,Michael
"Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.",5,2,Michael
For the North.,3,8,Jim
"I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.  I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels...",5,19,Pam
"Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.",9,9,Darryl
Right?,9,3,Jim
"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.",6,11,Michael
For me.,6,10,Oscar
So...,5,16,Jim
That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,4,2,Michael
When you lost the manager job-,8,21,Erin
"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?",8,14,Dwight
"They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.",7,10,Michael
You're being an idiot get..,9,16,Andy
Mint Dwight?,3,15,Jim
"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!",5,17,Andy
Mm. Mm-hmm.,8,24,Andy
"Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.",3,5,Pam
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.,5,21,Jim
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.,3,16,Michael
"Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! Come on everybody!",7,8,Michael
That’s regular pizza.,8,1,Pam
"Something with a ""K"".",2,12,Michael
On whom's authority?,3,7,Michael
Of course I checked it.,9,9,Dwight
"So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.",2,20,Oscar
"It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.",5,12,Dwight
Let's get this roof going.,2,3,Dwight
Would...,4,12,Jim
Chicken.,3,1,Pam
"With this move, he can't get you.",6,19,Dwight
"Well, I heard they made out and had sex.",2,8,Kevin
Her?,4,10,Pam
Umpf…that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.,8,6,Andy
"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",7,24,Dwight
Hmph.,8,5,Oscar
"Wow, very funny.",3,23,Pam
"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?",9,10,Angela
"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",5,5,Andy
"Sorry, that's not my problem.",2,20,Pam
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.,1,4,Dwight
Okay. Uh...,3,23,Michael
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,6,24,Michael
I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?,3,1,Michael
"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.",8,7,Dwight
"Jo, please... I will -",7,23,Dwight
I love you.,5,6,Pam
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.,6,8,Andy
"Yes, that's a good idea.",2,5,Michael
"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",3,1,Michael
"Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.",8,10,Erin
"Yeah, ok.",9,6,Andy
"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",8,6,Jim
"Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California!",8,4,Darryl
What card was she?,1,2,Pam
"I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. ""M"" your name is Mark.",5,14,Michael
"There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.",8,11,Darryl
"I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.",4,2,Ryan
Thanks Dwight.,6,11,Jim
Can we take a look at the suite now?,6,4,Pam
"Yeah, I say we just go for it!",7,22,Kevin
"An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. Pam, could you put Jan on, please?",3,6,Michael
"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",7,11,Andy
And then you go to school for three years.,2,4,Jim
I think you're great. You're my best friend.,5,8,Michael
How do you know it's a gun?,6,12,Phyllis
"Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.",7,13,Andy
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.,7,24,Dwight
Oh good. She broke up with you.,5,11,Dwight
I'm just leaving for the day.,2,9,Angela
Please. It’s Robert who’s enjoying it.,9,7,Oscar
"Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.",2,22,Kevin
"Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. Pull it over. Here we go.",5,5,Michael
"Listen, um… I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn’t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he’s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it’s better than a fairy tale. It’s like a long book that you never want to end. And you’re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.Woman 4 Like Harry Potter.",9,23,Pam
So it's faster.,7,7,Erin
"Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.",3,10,Michael
"Angela, until you face that, you’re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won’t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.",9,8,Oscar
"Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.",8,7,Andy
No... She's in a coma.,4,1,Michael
"I can’t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.",9,22,Oscar
Yessh.,4,8,Michael
"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.",8,14,Dwight
Dwight stopped the device!,8,6,Pam
Death of a salesman.,9,21,Andy
my weekend was bad so far.Pam's mom Oh--,6,4,Michael
"Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-",8,13,Oscar
"Get it, girl!",9,10,Pam
Those glasses are super dark.,6,4,Michael
Where was that.,7,18,Oscar
"This kid's costing us sales, Michael.",7,1,Andy
Anyone else? Nooo.,3,3,Pam
"When I was a salesman I could just be like “Not my job, not my prob. I’m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.” Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.",8,1,Andy
Yes! I have been so authorized.,7,8,Pam
"Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?",2,18,Michael
Just trying to be your friend.,2,5,Michael
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.,1,1,Michael
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?,9,11,Jim
...I'm so sorry. Sorry.,7,19,Erin
"Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.",7,10,Oscar
"Hey, man. Darryl.",9,18,Darryl
Ahhh. Mweehaa,2,12,Dwight
Who's there?,5,17,Michael
I can't believe I started the fire.,2,4,Ryan
No you would not.,3,9,Michael
"Dwight, please.",8,18,Jim
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.,9,16,Erin
"Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.",2,7,Michael
You're okay.,6,8,Pam
"Hey guys, any spots left?",8,14,Erin
And this is where I will record your sales.,4,3,Andy
"Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.",2,21,Jim
"Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... My resolution is... meet a loose woman.",7,12,Dwight
I. Understand. Nothing.,5,22,Michael
What should we ask?,7,6,Phyllis
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.,3,8,Jim
Kelly.,3,10,Ryan
"You're the one who trained me, Michael.",2,14,Dwight
"Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.",9,4,Erin
"Go away, we're running lines.",9,20,Andy
"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?",8,10,Dwight
"Alright! Nice job, Oscar!",8,3,Jim
"Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?",2,3,Michael
"That was really good, Darryl.",9,3,Jim
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.,6,23,Angela
No. We can’t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.,9,23,Dwight
You're not going to. You know where you're going?,6,16,Michael
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?,7,24,Jim
"Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.",4,6,Jim
And dumping her on her birthday.,6,8,Pam
"Okay, I'll try.",2,22,Jim
"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.",8,14,Dwight
"Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.",2,12,Pam
No. I don't want to do any of that.,3,13,Michael
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?,5,22,Michael
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.,7,9,Michael
"Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don’t—it just… I owe it to myself and my future fans.",9,21,Andy
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.,5,5,Pam
"Heyyy… let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!",8,16,Andy
I think I'm ready.,4,8,Jim
"It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.",9,4,Pam
I think he-,7,6,Phyllis
Yes.,5,9,Michael
Got any hot leads?,9,21,Andy
"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun. We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",2,14,Michael
I’m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.,9,23,Phyllis
"OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.",3,19,Jim
"Oh, thanks, Kelly.",6,16,Pam
I know what a flounder is.,6,7,Michael
"Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!",6,15,Erin
"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.",6,22,Dwight
Tell him I'm retired.,7,16,Michael
"Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! I have to go to the bathroom!",9,6,Kevin
"This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.",6,7,Darryl
"He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.",8,18,Pam
"I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. You were playing too.",6,24,Michael
"Not. I said, not that.",2,22,Michael
MR. JAMES HALPERT!,8,4,Dwight
"No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.",2,21,Phyllis
"Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",6,1,Jim
"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?",8,20,Andy
"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean.",6,5,Andy
"There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...",6,24,Michael
"Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk. Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  Oh, oh, oh. Alright.",2,12,Michael
"Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder.",2,12,Phyllis
"I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.",8,21,Phyllis
I'm on a call.,2,9,Oscar
Mmm-hmm.  Now you've got to drink.,2,14,Darryl
"Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!",2,1,Pam
"No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.",8,16,Pam
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.,2,8,Pam
Uh... Not a bad day.,1,2,Jim
"Yeah, that's no problem.",5,17,Pam
"Okay, here we go.Andy &",3,8,Michael
"Good night, Kevin.",9,21,Oscar
That’s true.,8,23,Dwight
"Uh… Well, it’s about Athlead. I’m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",9,13,Jim
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.,1,6,Michael
"...empathy, respect... Jim! Jim!",1,2,Michael
"Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-",9,16,Angela
And that is...,9,9,Pam
My name is Andy!,9,4,Andy
Andrew Bernard.,5,24,Andy
"Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.",9,6,Erin
Agoraphobic?,3,18,Jim
"Shush. Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.",5,17,Pam
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?,2,19,Dwight
"You're a real crumb bum, you know that?",8,6,Erin
You sure?,5,26,Jim
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,4,10,Michael
"It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",8,10,Andy
"If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?",7,21,Michael
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.,6,20,Michael
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.,7,14,Andy
Hey.,2,13,Jim
"Yeah, you don't?",2,19,Jim
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...,2,17,Jim
"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right.",6,11,Michael
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,4,3,Michael
That's not true.,2,14,Dwight
And I'll just watch him.,6,7,Pam
"Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.",6,17,Erin
"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",6,10,Andy
"The domain name. Yeah, they do.",7,9,Ryan
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.,3,12,Dwight
That was a bunt.,6,8,Michael
It's possible.,5,16,Oscar
Tip-top shape.,8,21,Kevin
"Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --",5,6,Jim
Website check please.,4,3,Andy
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.,4,2,Pam
You can be so modest sometimes.,5,20,Dwight
"Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. saved it.",3,19,Michael
That's as hard as I can hint.,6,14,Andy
I now find you repulsive.,4,2,Pam
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.,7,23,Dwight
Argggg!,2,6,Dwight
"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",2,11,Michael
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?,9,9,Darryl
This is all I could find.,7,12,Erin
Hey.,8,24,Jim
We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.,6,9,Jim
That's just a verb.,8,16,Dwight
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?,9,11,Dwight
Got it. To Dwight. Wha--  Starbucks gift card.,6,8,Dwight
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?,2,14,Pam
Don't just criticize my idea!,6,15,Ryan
Mmm...,5,2,Michael
Pam...you're missing things.,3,22,Michael
Is it true?,5,11,Andy
I'm not going to do that.,7,10,Pam
"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!",2,6,Dwight
"Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?",6,9,Michael
I had rebound? Yeah.,3,10,Michael
"I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.",8,14,Angela
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?,9,1,Andy
"Awwh, you're welcome. My pleasure.",7,17,Pam
Yeah... Who's opening?,8,22,Ryan
"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.",4,5,Pam
I'll be down in a minute. Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,5,10,Michael
"By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.",9,2,Jim
D-Bone. There you are.,8,2,Andy
Uncle Dave?,5,22,Ryan
You need a hair cut.,3,8,Angela
"No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",6,11,Pam
You want to keep this?,7,12,Erin
We’re so excited.,9,23,Pam
"That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...",5,14,Jim
No! I don't want natural!,5,3,Dwight
I’m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven’t done anything.,9,12,Erin
"You're right, that is new.",6,5,Andy
"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",7,6,Michael
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.,5,1,Andy
"There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.",4,3,Jim
"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",1,1,Michael
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.,2,17,Michael
"Yes, right in here, come on in.",2,12,Michael
"So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is DeAngelo!",7,20,Michael

It's his last Dundies.,7,20,Oscar

Sorry.,4,10,Pam
Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I’m going to refuse to take it.,8,7,Andy
"Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?",7,21,Andy
"Okay, let’s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?",9,7,Pam
"Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...",2,14,Michael
You like it?,7,11,Jim
"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.",4,8,Michael
"That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.",5,22,Ryan
"But then she goes on to say ""that will be our only topic of discussion"". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.",2,8,Michael
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.,4,2,Ryan
Michael! It's really good to see you.,5,13,Pam
"Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?",6,19,Michael
Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.,3,14,Michael
"Nice morning, too.",9,21,Pam
Tough.,5,24,Ryan
"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",2,5,Michael
"Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I did accomplish. But it's not mandatory. It's something that I... wanted to do... and so it's voluntary, really. Even though she... makes me. I think she just wants to hear my voice. Because we're no longer lovers, and she's just hurting. But things are going well with Carol. I've seen her seven times in the last few months, and I'm growing very fond of her kids. Tommy, who I call Tomas, and the little girl...",3,1,Michael
... dangling participle...,4,1,Pam
"Oh, ok.",2,6,Jim
"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.",5,22,Michael
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?,4,9,Dwight
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.,5,7,Michael
Catch-22.,2,6,Ryan
"No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.",3,16,Michael
"Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.",4,14,Angela
You got it.,9,4,Jim
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,6,23,Pam
"I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.",9,21,Dwight
"And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.",4,3,Ryan
I can play.,5,26,Angela
Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.,6,8,Andy
This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.,8,7,Erin
"Yeah, no, I don't think you can.",2,8,Jim
"Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?",2,9,Dwight
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.,4,5,Dwight
We're in.,5,16,Pam
"I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.",5,19,Michael
Whoa.,9,12,Kevin
"Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.",8,12,Erin
"Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?",2,9,Michael
"No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...",3,7,Jim
"Yeah, it's a little much.",7,15,Darryl
"So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?",2,14,Jim
Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.,4,2,Michael
"I'm the captain. Hey, charm school.",9,6,Andy
I'm just saying...,3,20,Dwight
"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here Michael handles more of the ""big-picture"" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...",6,15,Jim
"Oh, look at this. Tuna wrap.",8,13,Andy
"Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.",7,13,Pam
"I'll let you in on a little secret I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.",4,14,Michael
Yeah. Name another.,5,21,Andy
"Oh, he's plenty strong.",8,3,Oscar
"Oh, yeah",9,1,Jim
Woohoo!,4,6,Dwight
Do you want this?,1,6,Ryan
Go puck yourself!,7,16,Michael
Consider it nailed.,8,20,Andy
"The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.",8,3,Andy
What? How about yesterday?,9,11,Darryl
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.,2,13,Oscar
"Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",6,5,Michael
"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...",4,2,Pam
"It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. Ryan, can you come here a second? I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.",2,18,Michael
"Oh, I like it.",8,14,Dwight
"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",6,21,Michael
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.,8,13,Dwight
"Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?",2,9,Michael
"Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.",6,7,Erin
That's a ridiculous question.,3,20,Dwight
"A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. ""Connecticut."" And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he peels out, and I I don't make it to the car. Um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me... It was in the paper... But to answer your question, yeah, I'm really excited about this weekend.",3,2,Michael
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.,9,4,Dwight
Who says no moustache?,8,20,Jim
Because you think he's black.,3,9,Michael
This all sounds great to me.  But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.,7,22,Kevin
Toga!,4,14,Michael
"Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.",6,2,Pam
You guys...,3,19,Andy
You know me.,2,1,Dwight
"I don’t know, what do you mean?",8,2,Dwight
Mmm-hmm.,5,4,Jim
"On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.",2,10,Michael
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,9,5,Erin
A horse.,7,11,Michael
That is all. Have a good morning.,9,23,Dwight
"Uh, okay.",3,23,Michael
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!,9,5,Erin
I kind of am. It’s crazy.,9,5,Pam
"Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.",4,4,Ryan
"You know, try sending them another invoice.",4,7,Jim
Right. Do you see a clue or...,7,15,Andy
"Yeah, baby, here we go!",1,5,Michael
All right.,3,4,Michael
"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.",4,10,Jim
"That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.",4,6,Jim
"I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.",8,24,Angela
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,4,2,Michael
Okay!,4,1,Michael
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.,4,4,Pam
"Well, it's effective.",4,12,Darryl
The power source.,9,22,Dwight
I'll do it.,1,5,Phyllis
How is this on me?,7,24,Pam
Yes.Mr.,1,2,Michael
"And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.",2,15,Michael
Five years?,5,19,Oscar
"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.",6,20,Andy
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.,9,2,Andy
"If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.",6,19,Ryan
My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.,9,4,Dwight
"Excuse me, I got a question for you.",8,8,Dwight
"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.",6,24,Michael
"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",6,11,Michael
It's too small.,6,7,Dwight
I thought it was a fun idea.,8,11,Jim
"No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.",7,16,Michael
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!,7,3,Darryl
"OK, the health care plan.",1,3,Oscar
Quiet.,6,19,Erin
I was just... I'm in love with you.,2,22,Jim
"Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.",8,12,Erin
Post-it Notes.,1,1,Michael
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.,9,18,Oscar
"Hey, this is your apology letter.",5,13,Phyllis
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,6,11,Michael
"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!",4,6,Jim
"Nice.  Pretty soon, we’re gonna be at the ceiling.",9,8,Kevin
"But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?",5,2,Kevin
"Seriously, Kevin. I’m just gonna have to go to the store.",9,22,Oscar
M. Night Shulman?,6,18,Jim
Ed was decapitated.,3,4,Dwight
"I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.",7,17,Erin
Alright.,1,6,Jim
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?,5,14,Michael
"Yeah, who'd have thought?",4,14,Jim
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.,8,8,Andy
"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.",4,1,Pam
"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.",7,1,Michael
Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! What the? Damn it temp!,3,22,Dwight
"I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.",7,11,Angela
Your loss.,3,23,Michael
"That's exactly the point. You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us. You just have to remember, you know-",2,9,Dwight
"What is it? No, just tell me what it is.",2,14,Michael
"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---",6,11,Erin
"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So…my pitch is…me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.",8,6,Jim
Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.,3,17,Ryan
"Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.",2,13,Michael
"You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn. That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.",2,9,Michael
I bit my lip at lunch today.,9,10,Jim
Set that down. Present yourself.,8,4,Dwight
"That's good, let's wrap it up.",6,5,Dwight
This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.,3,3,Dwight
"I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?",3,23,Andy
"Okay, let's go over the plan again.",5,12,Dwight
"See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.",2,17,Michael
"Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.",7,1,Phyllis
Hanks.,7,15,Erin
"No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!",3,19,Dwight
Oh my God! You are so drunk!,2,1,Jim
Who told you that?,7,11,Pam
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,2,21,Dwight
"Hey, hey. Easy.",3,8,Dwight
You've got a booger bubble going on there.,9,16,Darryl
Can't you just tell us.,1,1,Oscar
"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.",3,11,Michael
"Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?",5,21,Pam
You're welcome.,3,4,Michael
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,4,12,Jim
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,6,4,Michael
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.,9,20,Jim
"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...",1,2,Michael
No. It would cause me too much pain.,8,21,Ryan
Why was he making her laugh so much?,8,7,Pam
"So, like a freedom tree.",4,1,Michael
"Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.",7,9,Ryan
Makin' progress. Yes?,2,21,Michael
I need to talk to you in private.,5,11,Andy
I'd think about it.,2,3,Dwight
"I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.",3,21,Michael
It's a statement of fact.,5,14,Dwight
"Guys, the Afghanistananies.",2,22,Jim
I bet.,2,16,Jim
Did you just mark on that?,1,3,Pam
We can't figure that out.,5,11,Jim
Or even uses the copier every day.,5,9,Pam
"Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?",1,2,Michael
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?,2,13,Michael
Sorry about that.,8,7,Jim
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!,2,4,Dwight
Let me getcha.,5,13,Michael
You need to get back on top.,6,18,Darryl
"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?",9,12,Dwight
That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.,5,2,Oscar
"My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...",8,12,Andy
So make that error!,8,11,Andy
"All right, we're starting over.",3,4,Michael
"Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.",4,3,Dwight
"Hello, waffle iron.",8,16,Erin
"Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh.",3,20,Dwight
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.,2,15,Michael
That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.,4,3,Dwight
The eyebrow.,2,20,Pam
Stay in bed!,7,20,Jim
You just use whichever one is sitting there?,8,19,Andy
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.,8,24,Jim
Well I'm not the receptionist.,8,15,Pam
"Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don’t want to leave yet. I haven’t had so much fun since seeing… zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.",8,17,Erin
"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",6,11,Jim
"Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.",5,6,Michael
Not… significant is a big word…,9,23,Dwight
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.,4,14,Dwight
"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",3,9,Jim
"Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre.",6,14,Erin
Ok.,6,4,Michael
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.,7,8,Michael
My wound hasn't healed yet.,8,18,Dwight
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I…,8,6,Andy
Building loyalty.,8,15,Erin
"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",4,5,Michael
You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.,9,16,Pam
Umm... sure.,3,4,Jim
Why would I hide it!,7,8,Erin
"That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.",5,19,Michael
"Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.",3,6,Jim
I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,4,2,Michael
Michael?,5,19,Pam
"Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?",4,14,Michael
"Ah, still early.",5,16,Michael
I'm your wingman.,5,7,Andy
"Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.",3,12,Andy
"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.Mr.",1,2,Dwight
I am so horny.,3,9,Andy
"So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.",7,22,Pam
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?,5,20,Ryan
"Um, my CDs.",4,4,Michael
"Yeah, I thought you started it.",7,5,Jim
Come on pam!Andy/,8,6,Andy
"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...",2,16,Dwight
"Yeah, we did it.",9,21,Darryl
Like you're applying for a loan.,4,13,Michael
400 and one penny.,5,4,Dwight
I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.,8,14,Pam
What's that?,3,20,Jim
I did?,2,10,Michael
Oh yeah? What's the first best?,8,16,Jim
I like your frames.,4,12,Phyllis
Or not adopt.,3,2,Pam
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?,7,9,Andy
"Well, why don't you shut up!",6,21,Kevin
"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like ""What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.""",5,6,Michael
We're losing cloud cover.,8,3,Andy
"Silent. Look, congratulations.",7,3,Darryl
It’s now or never.,9,21,Andy
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.,6,23,Michael
You own a bar?,7,6,Kevin
Ooh. It's coming down out there.,6,17,Andy
Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,4,2,Pam
"Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.",9,2,Erin
"Mmhmm, bravo!",7,21,Michael
The new guys called one.,9,1,Jim
Are we even sure that's my file?,5,6,Jim
No.,4,3,Michael
"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.",9,14,Pam
Well.,4,9,Michael
Hustle!,5,20,Dwight
"It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.",6,17,Pam
"Oh! God. Dwight, come on...",1,4,Michael
How long will that take?,5,26,Pam
That's not-,4,12,Michael
Where did you get that mallard?,6,6,Dwight
What is your weapon?,5,11,Dwight
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.,9,9,Dwight
No drama. Ok.,6,19,Andy
Chili's is great.,2,22,Michael
"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.",3,15,Dwight
What? Must’ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.,9,23,Darryl
That's nice.,6,4,Jim
The conference room!,5,5,Andy
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,2,10,Jim
"Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.",7,6,Kevin
"Hey, you know what? Come on, come on, let's go.",4,3,Michael
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.,9,2,Erin
"If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.",6,2,Darryl
"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",4,7,Michael
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.,8,3,Darryl
"Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!",3,22,Michael
Oh my God. Is that Jan?,3,11,Pam
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.,8,7,Ryan
"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.",6,2,Michael
"Yes, that's the problem.",2,21,Angela
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.',6,18,Dwight

Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,6,4,Dwight
"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",2,21,Dwight
Ah! That’s how it’s done.,9,21,Dwight
"Yeah, sell.",7,9,Andy
"And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.",5,9,Oscar
I would like to arrange a truce.,5,22,Dwight
"Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.",3,21,Dwight
"Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. Hey, who's that guy?",3,8,Jim
OK.,5,3,Michael
"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.",6,21,Andy
"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.",8,12,Andy
"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",6,3,Jim
"For real, you're not kidding?",5,24,Pam
"You’re a good assistant, Jim.",9,22,Dwight
"Anybody making out in here? Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here?",2,10,Michael
You all right?,5,26,Jim
Just don't get back together with her.,3,23,Pam
"No, Dwight! Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me. You're gonna sit in the back left where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.",4,6,Michael
Where'd I put what?,7,14,Jim
He is in my room icing his balls.,6,4,Pam
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,6,2,Pam
Hello. Scott. Table for four.,6,8,Michael
Who are you?! I don't know you!,6,20,Erin
"Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.",7,9,Ryan
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.,8,8,Andy
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.,6,5,Dwight
That's regular text talk.,8,16,Darryl
"Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.",2,15,Michael
Alright. Alright I get it.,7,10,Oscar
"Hey, how are you?",5,5,Jim
Stand clear.,2,15,Michael
At three different places.,2,12,Ryan
"Oh, nerd alert!",5,18,Michael
"Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I’m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she’s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it’s business as usual.",9,8,Oscar
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,2,10,Michael
"What are you doing, idiot?",6,18,Dwight
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.,3,10,Pam
We got our spaces back.,4,10,Kevin
"More than a friend, a co-worker.",6,6,Michael
Ohh...,3,10,Pam
No no no no no no no. I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.,6,9,Michael
"It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.",1,5,Michael
"Yeah, I'm okay.",6,4,Pam
"Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.",3,5,Ryan
What are you doing?,8,18,Jim
"Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...",2,14,Michael
That is not constructive.,5,17,Michael
Take a bowl and pass it down.,9,9,Dwight
"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",2,22,Michael
Michael's a genius.,5,9,Kevin
"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.",3,22,Michael
"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.",8,6,Dwight
How can you eat like that?,6,4,Michael
"Yeah. Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office.",4,7,Pam
"Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.",8,15,Kevin
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.,9,3,Darryl
"Hmm, I don't, know...",4,10,Pam
"Oh, yes. Doobie-doobie doo.",7,7,Michael
"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.",7,16,Michael
"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?",5,11,Andy
"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid.",7,16,Michael
"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",7,18,Michael
"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.",2,8,Pam
"Michael wrote down ""Astird.""",5,3,Angela
What do you got?,8,17,Andy
"I don't know, I just haven't.",9,9,Erin
Are you near sighted or far sighted?,3,14,Dwight
"Yeah, I'm busy right now.",2,9,Michael
I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.,5,2,Michael
"Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...",4,12,Kevin
Crisis averted.,3,17,Dwight
Found him!,4,6,Dwight
Undistributable.,6,14,Dwight
I think this is going great.,2,10,Michael
I don't know how to make that.,7,11,Oscar
...between us.,2,15,Michael
Is everyone licensed?Male Applicant 2 Like a driver's license?,8,3,Andy
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.,4,12,Dwight
"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",8,7,Dwight
No. I'm still waiting.,2,19,Kevin
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.,5,25,Phyllis
It can.,9,12,Darryl
"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not ""packaging."" Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?",3,11,Michael
"Rolph, leave it alone!",5,26,Dwight
"Well, look closer.",2,6,Pam
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.,2,1,Michael
"Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.",8,8,Dwight
"Nope, not at all.",6,3,Jim
Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.,4,1,Michael
He’s been sailing for two days.,9,7,Darryl
"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",1,4,Michael

Nobody cares what you think.,1,6,Michael
That is a great idea JB.,6,17,Michael
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!,6,3,Phyllis
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---,5,7,Michael

"Hey, Cece, Daddy’s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?",9,12,Pam
"Freeze, give me the list!",5,12,Dwight
There an accident? Somebody hurt?,3,11,Michael
I will. I will.,9,22,Jim
"Pam, stand up.",4,12,Michael
"First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -",6,18,Michael

"...You can take a five, if you want.",2,19,Michael
"No, because of the promotion.",3,10,Jim
Just making conversation.,4,10,Michael
"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.",1,1,Jim
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.,3,8,Michael

"I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! I feel exactly like a seahorse! Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.",7,8,Andy
"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. Busted, Halpert!",8,13,Dwight
That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.,3,4,Dwight
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?,9,12,Dwight
You just had a rebound.,3,10,Jim
"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.",6,5,Andy
"Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there’s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.",9,22,Dwight
Mmm... whoa.,6,10,Michael
Okay. Thought people read more books.,2,4,Jim
"Yeah, OK then.",9,4,Pam

"No, hey, Dwight shouldn’t...",9,7,Phyllis
"""In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."" He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. No doubt about it.",1,2,Michael
"Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.",5,8,Michael
Can you believe this? He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,5,13,Jim
You have everything?,6,4,Dwight
"Oh, I’m sure ...that’s nothing.",9,7,Oscar
"Oh-oh, come on!",4,6,Andy
And then my handsome husband...,8,3,Pam
"Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.",5,7,Michael
"Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary.",6,9,Angela
"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.",2,1,Michael
"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",4,7,Michael
"You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",5,16,Dwight
"I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.",3,20,Dwight
"No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.Police Officer 1 Really?Police Officer 2 Check this out.",5,8,Michael
"Talkin' bout, uh, what?",6,13,Michael
How's my favorite branch doing? All right .,5,1,Ryan

"Ok, say please.",2,6,Jim
Nnnnice. Wow!,3,3,Kevin
"Oh... come on, bear man. Come on.",7,11,Pam
"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it’s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...",8,10,Jim
Uh... Yes.,5,23,Michael
Well here we are... I would just like to...,5,19,Michael
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?,9,17,Dwight
My mom taught me that.,3,21,Phyllis
Who.,2,7,Michael

"Yes! You are entering the ""No Spin Zone!""",3,20,Dwight
"Um, what do you play? Center?",1,5,Michael
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?,6,23,Michael
"Haha, yeah. Say more nice things.",6,6,Pam
"I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. ""Hey, you think you can do my job better?"" I don't know. ""What's your name?"" Michael.",7,12,Michael
"Union! Union, yeah.",2,15,Darryl
"Rebel Yell, Billy Idol",5,21,Dwight

Toby...,6,2,Dwight
And I turned it down.,2,5,Dwight
"Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.",9,3,Erin
"Mail call! His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.",8,15,Andy
"Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.",6,4,Michael
Is everything ok?,9,21,Oscar
She's up! Great!,7,8,Pam
Like we're going to the science museum.,3,19,Michael
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.,5,11,Dwight
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check… on that later today. This is my grandmother’s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother’s buttock bullet ring.,9,22,Dwight
"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",7,11,Michael
"My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...",5,7,Michael
"Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.",8,20,Oscar
"You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.",7,21,Michael
"Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.",3,1,Oscar
"Here we go. Go get him, Mike!",5,5,Darryl
"Dwight, are you okay!?",9,10,Erin
You've got a ton of dandruff.,4,11,Dwight
"No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!",5,19,Michael
"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",8,10,Jim
Do not panic!,2,4,Angela
Toby works here again.,5,8,Jim
Check it again. Hit refresh.,3,11,Michael
Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.,3,21,Dwight
"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",6,21,Jim
You don't find Cathy attractive?,8,7,Pam
I can do a better one.,9,20,Andy
Michael do something about this.,7,10,Angela

"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.",6,9,Pam
"Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",2,14,Pam
Sure. Let me just finish this turn.,5,24,Jim
"Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.",2,22,Kevin
Eleven pounds...,6,16,Michael
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.,6,12,Kevin
"No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...HCT Member #3 He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here’s an old Treble classic.HCT",9,5,Andy
"Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.",6,16,Pam
What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?,6,1,Oscar
I miss her too.,8,15,Andy
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,5,10,Michael
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.,9,3,Darryl
"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. Jan Michael? Hello? Michael?",4,10,Michael

"Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.",7,10,Pam
"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.",2,1,Dwight
What do you...,7,15,Erin
You’ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?,9,23,Dwight
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.,2,18,Dwight
"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.",6,14,Pam
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.,9,18,Oscar
"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.",8,14,Dwight
Andy...,7,4,Erin
I work with Dwight.,5,9,Angela
"The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.",7,6,Kevin
"No, pictures are too interpretive.",5,24,Dwight
"OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.",8,3,Kevin
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,4,7,Michael
Sniffling how?,2,13,Dwight
But I don't think I am.,6,6,Pam
"Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.",9,6,Erin
Please?,2,6,Dwight
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.,6,2,Dwight
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.,4,3,Angela
Creed?,4,2,Oscar
I'm just walking around.,2,14,Michael
Karen Filippelli.,3,8,Dwight
"It's not fair, you guys.",8,8,Oscar
Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,4,1,Michael
"I knew it the whole time, buddy!",5,6,Dwight
"Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.",8,6,Pam
I have not found that to be the case.,6,4,Michael
Yes,6,1,Michael

Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!,3,22,Michael

"See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's-",2,9,Jim
"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",6,3,Michael
Does anybody else know about this?,6,1,Michael
"Well, then I will get a warrantee.",2,3,Michael
"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",8,13,Dwight
"During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump. We hit something with our jeep. It was probably a man. We didn't know what to do. We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could. We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home. Maybe it was just an ostrich. In a soccer uniform.",5,2,Phyllis
"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '",3,6,Michael
"Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.",4,11,Michael
"No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page. Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.",4,2,Michael
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?,2,17,Pam
"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",6,16,Michael
Meaning what?,5,7,Angela
I don’t…I don’t know why.,9,23,Angela
Nonsense. Get up here.,9,1,Andy
"Just checking in, how's it going?",4,13,Pam
"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",8,10,Andy
"Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.",5,12,Kevin
Okay. Okay. Is that too cold?,9,10,Erin
Fire hazard.,4,11,Dwight
We have fun.,3,16,Michael
"Oh, after you.Male church member Oh, no, after you.",7,7,Michael
"You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.",6,14,Michael
Not much.,6,11,Jim
"I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.",6,16,Michael
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.,7,5,Michael
It is six a.m. and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!De,7,20,Michael
"Jim, how dare you.",4,10,Dwight
Subway sandwiches.,9,18,Darryl
"Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.",2,4,Michael
"All right, let’s get this over with.",9,12,Darryl
... Schrute.,2,18,Dwight
Maybe over some coffee later?,7,10,Oscar
Would you like to help me with a special project?,1,6,Michael
"No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.",5,24,Dwight
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?,8,17,Oscar
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! Whoa.Ad guy 1 That's what we came up with.,4,5,Michael
"Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I’m gonna like it.",8,2,Dwight
I would love that.,4,8,Michael
"Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.",8,8,Ryan
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,2,3,Dwight
Let me get you some water.,5,13,Phyllis
"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?Ex-client OK thanks for the goodies.",4,2,Michael
"Sweetheart, you’re amazing, okay? You’re obviously gonna be on the show, so it’s someone else’s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, my name is Ezra Cornell and I’m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.",9,22,Andy
"Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.",4,4,Michael
"There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.",2,9,Michael
This conversation has two items on the agenda.,6,6,Dwight
"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.",2,10,Oscar
Who?,2,22,Michael
I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.,4,4,Michael
What happened in there?,6,5,Andy
"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",2,19,Michael
"If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?",2,4,Dwight
I drive a Saab station wagon.,3,20,Jim
Can you hop?,2,12,Kevin
"Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word.",2,7,Ryan
"And that is probably why most ads suck. Oh, that's them! Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film.  Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",4,5,Michael
"T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. You started with this company, as a fine young man...",7,21,Michael
I just... couldn't wait.,5,1,Jim
"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.",8,10,Andy
He went over your head to go behind your back.,7,6,Dwight
"I know, I know.",6,18,Michael
I'm taking one for my lady friend.,6,8,Michael
Can I speak to you a minute?,2,5,Michael
"Angela, you're more chipper than usual.",5,15,Oscar
Dothraas! chek!,9,3,Erin
Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.,2,11,Michael
But we're bonding down there!,2,15,Michael
Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.,6,4,Dwight
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.,5,18,Michael
"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",6,5,Dwight
Ugh.,9,16,Angela
And napkins... fanned.,5,10,Phyllis
Great. Thank you.,2,16,Michael
To push this bar up.,8,9,Darryl
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?,4,4,Ryan
Oh. Why me?,9,7,Pam
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.,2,15,Pam
Really well thank you all.,8,7,Pam
"Alright, let me turn on some music.",7,14,Jim
"Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.",2,7,Michael
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.,2,1,Dwight
"Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",7,17,Andy
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?,9,9,Erin
Mm-Hmm?,7,9,Pam
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.,7,9,Ryan
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.,3,10,Angela
"Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.",1,1,Angela
"OK, can we steer away from gay people?Mr.",1,2,Dwight
No way.,8,15,Jim
You know what to do. Ok,9,22,Dwight
I think it's going to be any minute now.,6,16,Michael
"Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?",8,22,Ryan
"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.",8,2,Pam
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.,3,13,Michael
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,3,8,Michael
"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",6,17,Michael
Pretty good.,7,13,Jim
"Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... I should have been more specific.",6,21,Oscar
"Hey, Kelly.",2,14,Jim
How close?,7,1,Dwight
"Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.",5,8,Ryan
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.,3,21,Jim
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?,3,9,Michael
My mother's in a wheelchair.,6,6,Oscar
Doubt it. Dwight and,6,5,Michael
You sure it's saber?,6,14,Andy
"Well, what? You could be referring to anything.",1,3,Michael
Hmm? No.,8,16,Jim
"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",6,14,Jim
I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That’s final.,9,19,Andy
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.,4,9,Angela
"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?",3,3,Michael
"What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?Ex-client Come on guys, get out of here!",4,2,Michael
We good.,9,14,Darryl

"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.",4,2,Andy
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,7,6,Michael
"Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?",5,22,Andy
Here. Like it?,8,8,Pam
That's all he wrote?,5,7,Ryan
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.,8,13,Oscar
That is just obnoxious.,5,8,Andy
"Well, I mean.",1,2,Jim
"No, he’s fine.",8,2,Angela
It's a surprise.,3,18,Michael
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.,7,11,Michael
I call for a refold!,9,20,Dwight
"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?",8,3,Pam
Interesting.,8,8,Erin
"Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?",7,14,Jim
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.,6,1,Michael
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?,9,18,Jim
Dwight... You just keep your eyes on the road.  Give me the bottle or you're fired.,2,12,Michael
Women friends?,6,1,Andy
"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",2,2,Michael
"Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.",3,4,Dwight
I was in The Whiz in high school.,9,20,Darryl
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,6,5,Michael
"Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.",3,8,Kevin
"Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. Na, nothing really. Kevin?",9,17,Andy
"Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-",5,26,Dwight
"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.",3,23,Dwight
A little eye for an eye action.,9,14,Dwight
Yeah. What? Us?,7,15,Pam
"No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.",3,3,Michael
"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.",4,10,Pam
It's fascinating.,9,16,Jim
"Yeah, I hate that.",4,8,Michael
"You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?",3,19,Michael
Why are you telling me this?,7,16,Michael
I'll do--,5,24,Dwight
Michael.,7,18,Pam
I was all-county my junior and senior years.,5,25,Phyllis
"Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.",8,18,Erin
"Hey, this is none of your business.",5,11,Dwight
"Uh, buying lottery tickets online.",8,3,Pam
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!,9,12,Dwight
"I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, ""muffin basket."" Then I thought, ""What’s even more precious to people than muffins?""",8,24,Dwight
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,6,17,Michael
"Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?",5,22,Dwight
"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.",2,3,Michael
"No, no. Give me the steam.",9,22,Dwight
Yes! We advance to the next round!,5,26,Dwight
"Not it's not, there's some in the straw. There, now you may throw it out.",1,6,Michael
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,6,10,Jim
"You wanna eat, don't you?",5,9,Dwight
Here you go again! What is your deal today?,5,5,Jim
"The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?",9,1,Kevin
But we get paid a lot less.,2,15,Darryl
"Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.",4,14,Jim
"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.",7,15,Pam
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.,8,10,Angela
"Me! Me, me, me.",2,11,Dwight
"Hello, Dwight Schrute?",6,17,Dwight
"I don't understand- Hold on. Sorry.  Yes, Pam.",2,8,Michael
You're gonna have to talk louder.,5,6,Jim
"Oh, so you've been to a real luau.",3,11,Kevin
An asset!,7,6,Phyllis
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.,7,2,Dwight
"Dwight, find out what the present is.",3,19,Michael
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,7,24,Jim
"Seriously, Angela?",8,21,Andy
Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.,8,2,Kevin
"Oh, wow.",6,6,Michael
We got Vikram!,5,20,Pam
"You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.",2,16,Pam
Two minutes apart.,6,16,Michael
Yeah.,6,1,Michael
"Church isn't a party, Michael.",7,7,Phyllis
"I did, yeah.",9,5,Jim
"I’m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don’t want him to do it anymore, and I don’t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.",9,19,Pam
That's rude.,6,4,Michael
"I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.",4,4,Jim
"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.",4,10,Dwight
"Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? ""Oscar. I am the Count."" Nailed him. Nailed him. Good work Cookie Monster.",6,20,Michael
"All right, OK.",5,3,Michael
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?,9,1,Angela
"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.",2,2,Michael
"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",2,10,Pam
Ugh.,8,21,Angela
"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?",8,24,Dwight
"Okay, good. Good.",4,5,Michael
Come on. So where you staying? Radisson?,2,22,Dwight
Welcome back Tuna!,6,17,Andy
You think it's easy?,5,9,Michael
I like her purple dress.,5,1,Phyllis
"Okay, uh, well, one is taken.",2,4,Michael
"Ah, OK.",8,3,Andy
"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",3,8,Michael
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.,2,20,Dwight
"Well, we won’t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.",9,19,Pam
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!,6,12,Andy
What? Are there two suns?,5,7,Dwight
"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.",1,4,Dwight
Erin has an audition to be a newscaster.,9,2,Andy
BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.,3,19,Michael
"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",8,20,Pam
Love you too. Bye.,9,10,Jim
Am I walking out?,1,1,Jim
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.,4,4,Darryl
"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? Yeah. Yeah, it does.",9,16,Andy
"Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters.",2,7,Jim
314 pies.,9,4,Kevin
"It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.",8,11,Oscar
Touche?,8,7,Jim
"OK, ready?",3,20,Michael
"Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.",5,6,Dwight
"Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.",7,21,Kevin
"Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.",2,17,Ryan
Got it. Then I will call you.,7,10,Andy
"Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.Mee-",7,7,Jim
"Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.",9,17,Dwight
"Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.",4,4,Michael
Here you go.,8,9,Erin
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!,8,1,Dwight
"No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.",2,22,Jim
"A check for the kids, and for the team.",1,4,Michael
One. Two. Three. Shot!,3,6,Andy
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.,3,8,Michael
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.,3,12,Kevin
"Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.",2,19,Michael
Yes! Woo!,8,12,Erin
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.,2,13,Oscar
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,2,19,Michael
"Stay out of this, you!",4,4,Dwight
"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.",2,3,Michael
"How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'",6,18,Jim
"People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.",9,17,Dwight
"I, uh... I am going to be a father.",3,2,Michael
"How about, I leave it up?",2,21,Angela
"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn’t get it. I shouldn’t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.",9,12,Pam
"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.",6,8,Michael
"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",2,22,Pam
What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?,5,12,Dwight
Blech.,5,20,Michael
And the final clue...,7,14,Jim
Let's call him and get the website.,3,1,Michael
I have absolutely no idea.,1,4,Dwight
What's her address?,2,6,Ryan
"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",6,22,Pam
"Oh, big yawn.",6,16,Pam
"That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Hah!",7,21,Dwight
Not really a rhyme.,4,9,Jim
No one else in this office is gay.,3,1,Oscar

"Hey Michael, how was your date last night?",4,11,Dwight
"In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.",4,3,Kevin
Put the game on hold everyone.,3,3,Andy
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.,7,6,Pam
"You can hear me, but I can't hear you.",5,22,Michael
"The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.",5,6,Dwight
Why?,7,12,Michael
"No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.",3,18,Dwight
"Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.",5,24,Michael
"Hey, and if you’re ever in Austin...",9,23,Jim
"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.",6,1,Pam
Jim! How 'bout you?,8,3,Andy
That’s not true. Just give me another chance.,9,1,Dwight
"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? Does that end the debate?",5,12,Jim
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.,3,13,Oscar
"Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?",8,11,Phyllis
"Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.",2,9,Jim
"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?",9,17,Jim
"We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!",7,11,Michael
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,2,17,Dwight
"Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-",2,7,Jim
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.,8,18,Jim
Good!,6,16,Michael
You should take up a musical instrument.,3,20,Jim
"Yeah, I think I can handle it.",2,13,Ryan
"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.",8,14,Dwight
She suckered you too.,6,21,Michael
'Free paper.',5,17,Jim
"Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!",8,22,Dwight
Really?,4,3,Michael
You are an impressive specimen.,6,19,Dwight
"Yeah, you want to play you little hick?",8,12,Dwight
"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.",2,19,Dwight
"No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?",3,19,Darryl
What? You have something you want to say?,2,15,Pam
"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",3,3,Michael
"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",2,10,Dwight
"Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.",6,5,Oscar
"I can’t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.",9,5,Darryl
"Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",7,7,Jim
"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend?  Hi, Dwight.",5,16,Dwight
"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?",3,11,Michael
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.,9,17,Pam
"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, ""I'm sleeping with your wife."" And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.",6,23,Michael
Oh that I plagiarized I think.,6,8,Michael
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.,5,1,Andy
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.,4,1,Angela
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that’s on me. But I’m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you’re feeling sentimental.",9,22,Darryl
"Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.",3,18,Michael
Just let me have... Oh.,5,20,Pam
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.,3,21,Michael
"No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!",5,15,Angela
"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?",5,6,Michael
Oh!,2,12,Jim
That's a racing stripe.,4,12,Andy
Here we go.,5,6,Michael
You broke my heart too.,8,19,Andy
"Barf! Ugh, you suck!",8,21,Pam
...when I thought I had skin cancer.,4,1,Kevin
"Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this!",7,21,Michael
"Two charges of loitering,",2,3,Dwight
"Oh, hey, I’ll take a coffee.",9,13,Dwight
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.,6,21,Michael
"Hey, what's up?",8,20,Pam
"What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?",9,3,Darryl
"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?",4,8,Michael
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.,6,19,Michael
You need to do something about your B.O.,2,8,Dwight
Luke is my nephew.,7,1,Michael
Where are you getting this information?,7,10,Oscar
And you guys thought this was a good idea?,8,11,Oscar
Yeah.,6,18,Michael
What do we got here?,6,17,Jim
"Ok, well it wasn't obvious so...",7,14,Pam
"Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I’m here.",9,22,Darryl
"You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.",5,5,Andy
"Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?",5,20,Michael
"Alright everybody, who’s in? Angela? Don’t make us come over there.",9,11,Kevin
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.,6,5,Michael
Good.,2,20,Michael
You're horrible.,1,6,Pam
"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.",2,13,Michael
"No, you don't have to do that.",5,15,Michael
Wha – what is this supposed to be?,8,23,Dwight
"Oh you don't, that's-De",7,21,Michael
"And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.",2,15,Michael
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!,4,2,Angela
"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum ""Suck It"" to the U.S. military.",8,24,Andy
"""Don't..."" Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...",2,8,Michael
"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.",5,21,Michael
"Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.",2,4,Kevin
My Phillip is crawling.,8,16,Angela
"Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",7,24,Dwight
"No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.",3,8,Michael
Eight? Really?,9,16,Pam
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.,7,9,Ryan
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?,8,3,Jim
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,5,13,Dwight
"I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",4,1,Michael
I miss you.,5,3,Jim
"No, no, no. I’m wearing makeup.",9,22,Andy
That is a great idea.,5,16,Pam
But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.,3,3,Michael
"If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right?",3,16,Ryan
"Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.",8,21,Pam
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?,5,2,Michael
"So, really, you're just calling her?",3,10,Jim
"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...",2,18,Michael
"I... love it!! Haha, come on!",4,12,Michael
"Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.",7,23,Jim
Have a good game man.,1,5,Jim
"Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?",4,2,Kevin
Pam Halpert.,8,5,Pam
Sounds good.,7,12,Jim
This is not enough for you and I’m afraid that I’m not enough for you.,9,22,Pam
Ok. Sure.,3,12,Pam
Do you own a gun?,2,3,Dwight
"Yeah. Yeah. It’s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...",9,5,Jim
"I don't know about, love...",7,8,Jim
"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.",8,11,Andy
"Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.",4,3,Kevin
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.,9,16,Dwight
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.,2,6,Dwight
"Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.",3,11,Michael
"Um it is, Grotti.Andy and",6,5,Michael
"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",6,21,Michael
"Thanks, Oscar.",8,4,Andy
What the hell's a rundown?,5,21,Jim
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.,4,11,Andy
"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",6,3,Jim
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.,4,1,Pam
"Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.",3,21,Andy
Do you have specifics?,5,18,Oscar
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,1,4,Dwight
"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.",5,22,Michael
I’m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.,8,5,Erin

"Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!",4,6,Dwight

sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.,8,22,Oscar
"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 830. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.",6,17,Michael
What'd he say? What did he say?,7,5,Dwight
"Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",5,24,Michael

Hey! Sweetheart! I have missed you so much.,9,15,Andy

Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?,1,4,Jim
We have to have done something wrong.,4,1,Michael
Think it through.,2,17,Dwight
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,8,14,Andy
"Wait, what is this?",9,23,Angela
"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",6,9,Jim
"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?",5,4,Dwight
"At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.",9,19,Andy
"Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",8,13,Dwight
"Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",2,10,Pam
"Ooh, why is it shaped like that?",8,2,Phyllis

He’s here.,9,8,Angela
I'm not sick! I'm burned!,2,12,Michael
"If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert…man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how’s the sales doubling …project going?",8,2,Andy
... not what I meant.,5,26,Andy
"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",3,1,Dwight
Yes it is!,5,18,Michael
"No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",7,2,Jim
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.,2,22,Pam
How ya doin'?Mr.,6,4,Michael
"Oscar, I would be proud to date you.",6,4,Kevin
"Yeah, they're really great together.",8,21,Pam
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?,8,10,Andy
It's a deal.,3,2,Michael
"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",6,23,Andy
I got it!,5,26,Pam
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?,3,16,Michael

"Just go down, Kevin.",5,25,Oscar
"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",2,1,Pam
Holy s*** is that real?,7,18,Pam
1-8-5-0-5.,8,17,Pam
What is that... word?,4,2,Michael
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,6,4,Dwight
"Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?",4,14,Michael
Do Not Resuscitate…,8,2,Pam
What's your money situation?,7,9,Oscar
"When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!",6,17,Michael
Love that one.,5,5,Jim
What are you wearing? Who's Pat?,6,5,Michael
So you fell in?,6,7,Angela
"I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.",6,19,Pam
"Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.",6,16,Kevin
"I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?",5,22,Michael
"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",7,6,Jim
"No, we are not.",3,22,Michael
Whoa.,9,22,Kevin
"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",3,8,Michael
"""You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name."" You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.",8,15,Dwight
"An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.",3,4,Pam
Damn it!,3,22,Dwight
He looks happy.,6,15,Pam
You want music?,3,20,Jim
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.,6,18,Dwight
"Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!",3,9,Michael
Just sell it.,2,14,Michael
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -,5,25,Jim
I want an outsider.,7,24,Ryan
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?,5,3,Kevin
"What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three ""M""s. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.",2,14,Dwight
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,6,9,Jim
I just want it to stop.,7,11,Jim
"No, I'm not gonna do that.",2,16,Jim
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?,2,2,Darryl
"I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.",4,1,Michael
"Good morning, can I help you?",5,16,Pam
You know I was thinking...,6,16,Angela
"I'm not wearing a wire, so...",5,8,Michael
"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",6,22,Jim
"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",6,11,Andy
"Heh, okay, weirdo.",5,8,Michael
Andy? You all set?,7,24,Jim
Two HR reps.,5,2,Ryan
It's not pizza.,4,3,Oscar
"Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.",9,20,Jim
"No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!",6,6,Pam
Just put it out of your mind.,5,23,Ryan
She touched my shoulder.,6,16,Kevin
I'd still like one.,2,20,Kevin
Introduce yourself. Be polite.,1,1,Michael
"All right.  And she won't say, ""I love you.""",6,22,Michael
"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",6,16,Pam
Welcome.,9,22,Dwight
Just amongst ourselves.,5,23,Michael
"Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.",8,18,Erin
"Yeah, we can go eat pie.",4,14,Kevin
But we signed the contract.,6,19,Angela
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.,7,8,Pam
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.,3,5,Ryan
"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.",2,22,Michael
"Um, what?",3,14,Pam
She's trying.,8,22,Darryl
"That's... What do you mean, ""Michael""? That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!",4,14,Michael
I'm good! How are you? So...,3,8,Ryan
We had already applauded.,4,5,Dwight
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.,3,13,Dwight
I didn't see where it was.,3,10,Kevin

"Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.",1,6,Michael
"Oh, there it is. J1.",2,11,Jim
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.,4,5,Andy

"No Bob, we worked it out.",6,12,Phyllis
"I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.",5,21,Michael
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.,7,20,Michael
"And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.",8,18,Jim
"Wait, when was this?",2,7,Jim
You wanna go out?,5,3,Michael
Okay. Whoo!,3,4,Dwight

Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.,6,11,Michael
"Okay, I got this one.",9,8,Kevin
"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, ""Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?"" And he looks at me and he says, ""Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket."" And I look back at him and I say, ""I feel the need!... The need for tweed.""",5,11,Michael
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?,4,11,Oscar
"It did, all ready.",4,4,Ryan
Sorry. Her day.,5,22,Jim
"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!",5,15,Jim
That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.,7,15,Pam
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,5,13,Dwight
"Oh, I like Olive Garden.",8,8,Phyllis
"Speaking of pimples, let’s release the BLOGGERS!",8,17,Dwight

Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?,9,12,Pam
All right.,6,20,Michael
I must...,8,12,Jim
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.,2,15,Ryan
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!,3,10,Angela

"Hey, congrats on the bonus.",4,4,Michael
"Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",6,11,Michael
"Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.",7,9,Dwight
"Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.",4,1,Michael

"Hey, Darryl.",9,23,Jim
"Wait, can you go back?",3,5,Ryan
"I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.",5,18,Michael
Leave me al--,5,13,Michael
"Alright, everybody here? Yes.",3,3,Michael
"Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.",7,9,Dwight
"I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.",5,26,Michael
"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",8,5,Jim
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!,6,12,Phyllis
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.,6,4,Phyllis
"Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said...",6,2,Michael

"Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.",7,21,Phyllis
"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",7,1,Michael

Jo! We were not expecting you!,6,24,Michael
Do you take requests?,5,10,Jim
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,6,15,Dwight

He just won’t go down. It’s as if he’s excited by all this paper.,9,22,Oscar
"Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint. Um, did you meet me at the gym?",3,17,Ryan

What?,3,2,Michael
"I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about?

Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it.,4,9,Jim
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.,6,14,Kevin
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.,8,16,Dwight
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,2,10,Michael

"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",5,17,Michael

I didn't eat lunch. I didn't eat all my lunch.,5,15,Kevin
"Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...",2,16,Dwight

"Okay. It’s just the wind, see? Nothing.",9,23,Phyllis

Next-ish.,2,12,Michael
"Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.",9,23,Pam
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.,5,21,Michael
"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",5,16,Dwight
I've been turned into a puppet!,7,24,Erin
"I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.",3,23,Michael

What do I see in Angela?,5,7,Andy
"So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything.

"Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",4,1,Michael
"These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of ""A Nutcracker Christmas."" I think you should leave.",3,10,Angela
"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.",5,13,Andy
Elaborate.,7,7,Jim
"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.",6,3,Jim
You have CDs?,4,4,Oscar
I can't even say it. H-I...,7,4,Michael
"Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!",3,20,Dwight

"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.",8,15,Dwight
"All right, attention everyone.",5,9,Michael
Very good.Student 2 In the digital age...,3,16,Michael
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the ""Vagina Monologues"" called the ""Penis Apologies."" So I know a thing or two.",7,22,Andy
It’s just a really nice song.,9,21,Angela
I know who did that.,6,18,Darryl
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.,2,5,Jim
"Hey, how are you and Darryl?",5,6,Jim
"Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.",7,12,Erin
Yeah exactly. It's my turn.,5,21,Pam
Why don't... Let's...,5,11,Jim
"You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!",9,3,Andy
"Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.",3,4,Michael
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,6,20,Dwight
I don't see a... price.,3,16,Michael
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.,8,8,Kevin
I'm sitting right here.,7,10,Darryl
"Let me think about it... I, um... there...",5,11,Angela
"Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.",6,16,Jim

Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.,6,4,Michael
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.,3,12,Michael
"You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.",5,23,Dwight
"Well I have the, the blue book value...",4,12,Andy
He’s absolutely right. I’m really struggling.,9,7,Erin
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,2,20,Michael
Or real bombs.,4,6,Dwight
Dwight is my friend.,4,9,Michael
I could have stopped him.,6,23,Dwight
"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.",1,1,Michael
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?,1,3,Dwight
Higher.,6,22,Darryl
"Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-",5,4,Michael
"You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.",6,7,Darryl
"Thought about it, I'm in.",4,9,Andy
"Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.",5,25,Michael
"We could go there, sure.",5,10,Michael
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?,9,9,Dwight
"Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.",7,1,Phyllis
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?,9,20,Andy
Feel better?,6,8,Jim
They fall under the category of airplanes.,4,2,Dwight
"I'm Robert Mifflin. Ah, okay.",5,26,Michael
"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.",2,5,Pam
"Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.",5,6,Dwight

Dwight! Dwight!,8,7,Jim
Da na na na na...,5,5,Michael

"Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.",8,24,Dwight
"You don't have to do that, Kevin.",7,12,Pam
"Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.",8,4,Andy
Hey.,4,7,Jim
Take this pen and stab me with it.,2,6,Dwight
"Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.",6,16,Michael
Cut. That was your best apology video ever.,3,20,Pam
"Come on, Andy, seriously.",7,3,Michael
Are you happy you did?,5,8,Ryan
"Now watch, let me take you from behind.",2,6,Dwight
"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.",6,18,Michael
Get out of here moron!,9,6,Dwight

Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry sorry sorry.,7,20,Erin
"Oh, okay.",4,14,Michael
"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you"".",2,8,Michael
"Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.",7,11,Phyllis
I apologized for that.,1,5,Dwight
That's true. That's right. Yeah.,5,24,Jim
He hung up?,5,18,Dwight
Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.,9,5,Dwight
Pro-Am.,4,1,Michael
"Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,",7,8,Erin
"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?",9,16,Andy
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.,8,6,Oscar
"Or, ""Total Eclipse of the Fart.""",4,14,Michael
Cake? Who suggested cake?,5,1,Michael
She'd be perfect for you.,1,6,Jim
Let's see...,5,9,Michael
"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.",1,4,Jim
"People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us."" I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",1,1,Michael
We're friends. We'll always be friends.,3,8,Pam
"Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.",8,24,Dwight
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.,6,17,Michael
A knife.,5,4,Dwight
"We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!",6,19,Andy
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.,5,25,Michael
"No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,",7,13,Andy
Okay.,6,17,Michael
"Thanks for the party, Michael.",2,10,Kevin

"Hello, you're back.",3,11,Dwight
"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",6,15,Michael
"What, huh?",1,2,Michael
"Well, your office is behind you.",2,20,Jim
You should've put him in custardy.,1,1,Ryan
"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",8,7,Pam
That's a lot.,5,19,Oscar
It’s the only thing that will make this right.,9,8,Angela
"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.",3,6,Michael

"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",6,11,Michael
"Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.",8,15,Erin
I'll call a cab.,4,2,Dwight

"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming!",3,21,Pam
I got it.,4,2,Pam
"Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we’re gonna do this right.",9,22,Darryl
We are?,6,22,Michael
Lower,6,18,Erin
"Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.",8,20,Phyllis
"My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we’re not really friends.",8,17,Erin
Don't let-shh!,8,16,Dwight
"So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?",6,16,Erin
"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.",9,1,Andy
"This looks great, Michael.",5,20,Pam
I think... you're a witch.,8,19,Pam
No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.,6,8,Jim
"Hey buddy, so every-",6,11,Dwight
Two dates? Three dates?,8,5,Erin
No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.,4,2,Ryan

"Cool. Hey, thanks…",9,11,Darryl
Hello Jo.,6,17,Michael

It's simpler this way.,8,4,Dwight
"Oh, god!",7,5,Michael
"On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.",3,20,Dwight
"Sure, I um..I didn't know.",9,6,Andy
"OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.",3,13,Oscar
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?,3,16,Michael
"Alright. Alright!  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...",5,1,Michael
What I want all of you to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?,3,8,Michael
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.,4,2,Angela
"Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.",6,5,Kevin
Yeah.,6,2,Michael
Forgot normal talk.,4,8,Michael

Ugh.,8,18,Angela
Jim.,6,1,Pam
"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-",2,8,Michael
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...,9,20,Andy

"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",2,20,Michael
"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.",8,24,Jim
Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?,3,19,Dwight
"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.",8,14,Dwight
"I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.",7,3,Erin
"I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, ""Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.""",5,14,Michael
"Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?",3,19,Darryl
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,3,23,Michael
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,7,6,Michael
There we go.,7,1,Pam
"Oh, well, then, email it to me.",5,12,Michael
Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.,7,6,Jim
He welcomes you.,9,22,Jim
"Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.",5,22,Michael
"You made a ""P.""",1,3,Pam
"Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?Businessman #3 Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you’re all set.",9,5,Jim
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.,4,5,Oscar
Who else here is single?,6,16,Michael
No. No more talking. It's movie time.,9,9,Erin
What? Something happened?,2,17,Dwight
I think so. Okay.,8,7,Pam
"Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.",6,6,Michael
What can't you tell me?,3,7,Pam
"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",7,11,Michael
"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.",8,24,Andy
The what now?,5,9,Michael

I made it with my cheese pita.,4,3,Michael
"You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.",7,5,Michael
Ahhhh!,4,5,Michael
What’s going on?,9,21,Pam
"No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.",7,7,Michael
I'm still enjoying it.,6,18,Kevin
"Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...",3,17,Michael
"In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.",7,3,Michael
"Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.",3,23,Dwight
"Alright, have a good trip.",9,20,Pam
"No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.",3,5,Dwight
Am I the only one that’s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?,9,23,Jim
"I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!",5,3,Dwight
Are you kidding me?,5,24,Michael
Still said it.,3,20,Kevin

"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.",6,9,Dwight
"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.",1,4,Jim
Should we just keep opening up the presents?,2,10,Kevin
"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",6,3,Michael
"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, ""just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.""",7,24,Jim
"I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?",7,22,Dwight
Like it.,6,14,Michael
"Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.",2,7,Jim
"OK, I'm ready.",6,9,Dwight
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,6,21,Michael
"Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.",7,18,Dwight
"I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.",8,1,Kevin
"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",2,21,Michael
Just...,4,3,Michael
Sounds great.,9,6,Darryl

I move we sell!,7,9,Pam
"Oh, and then this was Phyllis’s idea… So nasty Phyllis!",8,2,Pam
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?,9,2,Kevin
One order.,8,16,Kevin
"Oh, Angela.",9,21,Oscar
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.,7,7,Pam
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,7,6,Michael
And day.Andy and,8,7,Kevin
Any specific animal?,8,6,Dwight
"Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.",9,20,Erin
"No, today at work.",3,14,Michael
"How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.",6,23,Michael
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,6,23,Dwight
Actually… You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I’ll take one too.,9,11,Dwight
Do it now.,4,12,Dwight
He’s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.,9,7,Dwight
"Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.",9,22,Andy

"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...",5,9,Andy
"Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. Suite 401.",6,7,Andy
Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here.,8,6,Andy
Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.,6,19,Jim
"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?",7,5,Michael
Bring it on guys.,8,12,Andy
Things have been generally good.,5,24,Ryan
Hey.,3,2,Jim
"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours. We're half way done.",7,2,Michael
"Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Heh-woh you.",3,17,Michael
What is happening right now?,7,24,Jim
"Follow me, I got a space. After you. I’ve been thinking about you all mornin’. I don’t know what you did, I can barely walk today.",8,2,Darryl
"Can you hear me, they talk about us...",2,13,Michael
What's happening?,3,21,Michael
"Hey, you.",5,20,Ryan
"Okay. Good, good, good.",9,13,Dwight
"Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.",9,18,Dwight
"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word “no” not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I’m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.",8,1,Andy
"I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.",7,24,Erin
Andy--- Ohh...,3,20,Jim
"Agreed. But that's all, okay.",5,23,Pam
"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!",8,8,Andy
"You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.",1,3,Dwight
"It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...",6,19,Michael
"No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",8,3,Jim

Took ‘em one day.,8,2,Andy
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.,4,14,Michael
"Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?",4,2,Angela
I'd rather not say.,6,6,Ryan
"Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.",8,23,Andy
"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.",7,7,Michael
"Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.",5,1,Michael
Smoked turkey.,1,1,Pam
Those posters used to be real French ads.,7,8,Erin
"Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  False. I do not miss him.",3,1,Dwight
You got a bonus check?,2,10,Oscar
"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",5,13,Pam
"I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, ""Fleece it out."" ""Going mach five."" ""Dinkin' flicka."" You know, things us Negroes say.",2,22,Darryl
"Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.",6,18,Oscar
Dear God in heaven.,7,11,Dwight
"Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.",5,5,Michael
It didn’t have a buster sign around him? Why don’t you draw him? Why don’t we see this whole thing.,8,5,Jim
Puppet.,8,15,Jim
Val.,9,10,Phyllis
"We have three rooms, each with a different theme.",4,4,Dwight
I’ll take five.,8,2,Jim
Just wait and send it to voicemail.,9,21,Dwight
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.,8,17,Pam
"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? Tuna.",8,2,Andy
"Stanley, could you come with me, please.",2,5,Dwight
"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",6,20,Michael
Yes. And he didn’t like it.,9,12,Angela
"See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.",7,19,Pam
"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",1,3,Michael
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.,8,20,Erin
It's okay. I'll see you at home.,2,22,Pam
"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.",5,9,Dwight
"Just put ""The Hospital."" Contact number just put 9-1-1.",2,6,Dwight
Whoo!,9,23,Erin
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.,7,6,Darryl
Come on! Ryan!,5,21,Pam
"Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.",2,17,Dwight
"Michael, can you explain?",2,17,Dwight
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.,9,9,Erin
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.,2,4,Michael
"Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.",2,19,Ryan
"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",6,17,Michael
"It's European, OK? It's a European cut.",3,18,Michael
Yep. Oh... wow.,5,23,Michael
"How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",4,4,Michael
Did you have a good weekend going there?,1,2,Michael
"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.",4,11,Jim
"Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.",2,19,Jim
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot… these.,8,23,Andy
"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?",5,1,Michael
Taking a load off huh?,8,9,Darryl
So you have the directions.,5,1,Jim
"No, that's skeptical. Do sad.",4,5,Michael
"Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?",9,12,Phyllis
"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",3,4,Pam
Two minutes...,6,16,Jim
"Exactly, thank you.Mary-",2,9,Michael
Oh. Please. Colin Powell.,3,9,Michael
"Ready? One, two, three...",6,16,Jim
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. It's not bad.,3,3,Jim
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?,8,13,Ryan
I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.,9,7,Andy
"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?",3,9,Andy
Almost.,2,15,Pam
"Thanks for inviting us, by the way-",9,2,Jim
"Oh, tell him I say hi.",3,2,Jim
There is one problem with this plan.,8,11,Andy
...would I go near---,3,19,Michael
Michael?,2,8,Pam
"Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.",9,18,Dwight
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.,7,9,Kevin
Presbyterian.,4,1,Darryl
"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.",8,13,Andy
Oh how dare you.,5,17,Michael
Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?,3,21,Jim
"Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.",2,1,Jim
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I've only sold one copy.,8,4,Jim
"Now, how can I help you?",5,25,Dwight
Um...,2,15,Pam
Is it called red-vining?,9,8,Dwight
Yes! We do. Eclairs.,6,18,Jim
The bride and groom? What are their names?,3,15,Dwight
"Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.",7,19,Erin
"Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",3,9,Pam
This place has gone to hell.,6,18,Dwight
"All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. ""Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?"" Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.",1,4,Michael
All right.,5,14,Michael
I have a tambourine.,8,7,Kevin
And how many would you like?,4,14,Jim
"Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!",8,22,Jim
I will know.,4,6,Dwight
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.,3,19,Dwight
"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you’re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.",9,22,Dwight
Alright! Here we go!,7,19,Michael
"Meredith, don't.",8,5,Oscar
At a gas station.,7,18,Jim
"No, it's... involves the photograph.",3,11,Dwight
See? That wasn't so hard.,8,24,Pam
"You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?",6,19,Michael
Twenty points.,8,2,Andy
Yeah. I have my copies.,5,9,Pam
Not my style.,3,3,Dwight
"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...",1,4,Jim
"Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.",8,16,Oscar
Did you just come up with that?,2,3,Jim
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.,2,4,Michael
"So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?",7,19,Darryl
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?,4,14,Michael
"I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, ""Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?""",4,3,Michael
"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.",6,5,Andy
Yeee... (grunts in frustration),4,2,Jim
"What do you need, Michael?",5,8,Pam
"No, we can't.",7,15,Michael
Oka--,2,18,Michael
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,5,9,Michael
Hm?,8,19,Andy
Come on!,4,12,Dwight
"Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.",6,1,Dwight
"No, I'm whipping them.",5,20,Michael
Definitely no.,9,1,Oscar
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?,5,22,Pam
"Ok, wait wait wait wait...",2,12,Pam
"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",6,16,Michael
"You know, I would love to put a pin in that.",5,19,Dwight
What a horrible day.,4,3,Michael
So let's have it at the hospital.,6,16,Jim
Okay.,4,1,Michael
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.,9,6,Angela
Live and let live.,5,12,Michael
"Ok, cool.",2,17,Pam
"Angela, you're up.",2,10,Dwight
I was right.,5,6,Dwight
Let's do that.,6,16,Michael
"Oh, you guys. Just one second.  Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.",6,8,Pam
Okay.,7,13,Michael
He should pay.,8,10,Phyllis
"Oooooo, saucy.",6,9,Andy
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,2,3,Michael
No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.,7,22,Jim
Is there a cookie?,5,25,Kevin
"Ow, my ankle!",5,26,Phyllis
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.,1,6,Michael
Right what?,5,11,Michael
"Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?",4,8,Jim
That's what I'm talking about!,2,11,Darryl
"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.",6,1,Dwight
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.,3,22,Michael
You down with the Dundies?,2,1,Michael

Oh.,3,6,Jim
He’s fine. He gets carsick really easily.,9,19,Dwight
"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.",6,23,Dwight
Yeah?,2,11,Michael
What you mean uh hmmm... ?,2,12,Michael
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.,5,24,Michael
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.,4,13,Michael
"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.",6,23,Andy
"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.",8,2,Pam
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.,8,8,Andy
"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. ""Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.""",3,7,Jim
"This, man. I can’t do this to Pam.",9,21,Jim

"Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",4,2,Dwight
"What connotations, Michael? You meant something.",1,2,Oscar
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?,2,20,Pam
What the...,2,18,Dwight
I made a vow. I gave my word.,9,16,Angela
Don't... get... on. Do not.,6,1,Pam
What does this say?,7,8,Andy
"Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?",6,13,Michael
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,5,17,Pam
She's sleeping with you?,5,11,Dwight
I’ll stall him. Go!,8,23,Dwight
"Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!",4,6,Jim

He's lying.,4,6,Dwight
"Uh, just put him through to me.",7,24,Pam
Put it down.,9,16,Phyllis

"Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.",9,19,Andy
"Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.",1,4,Michael
What have you done for me?,7,6,Darryl
"If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.",8,16,Dwight
Yeah.,2,19,Michael
Okay. Fine. No more PDA.,7,15,Michael
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?,6,17,Andy
"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.",5,15,Pam
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.,5,22,Pam
You okay?,5,7,Jim
"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",6,1,Michael
"Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.",9,14,Angela
"How you doing, Jordan?",7,23,Dwight
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.,8,7,Pam
"He creeps me out. But, I think he might be a genius.",7,24,Jim
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,1,1,Michael
"Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.",1,4,Michael
"No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines.",7,21,Kevin
"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.",2,15,Darryl
"So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?",9,4,Jim
"This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.",8,23,Erin
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?,8,24,Jim
I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.,3,1,Michael
Cut it out.,1,6,Pam
"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?  I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, ""Here Comes Treble.""",3,1,Andy
Hundred and twenty points.,8,2,Andy
"All right!  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...",4,5,Jim
"I’m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.",9,22,Dwight
"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.",6,15,Jim

Move!,3,21,Dwight
"Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!",7,3,Pam

Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!,6,12,Michael
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.,7,8,Jim

"Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?",2,17,Dwight
Again with the cousin.,6,2,Phyllis
"No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.",2,17,Dwight

I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over.

Every day.Andy and,8,7,Darryl
"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",1,1,Michael
Some of these kernels have crowned.,9,4,Dwight

"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",2,22,Michael
"For instance, why don't you go to business...",2,4,Michael

Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!,5,20,Andy
"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.",1,1,Michael
What else could you possibly be forgetting?,9,9,Darryl
"I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....",5,5,Oscar
"When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.",6,19,Kevin
"You blew the sale, you idiot.",6,7,Pam
"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really.",7,15,Dwight

And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.,7,24,Pam
"Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.",2,22,Jim
"Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from ""Look Who's Talking."" What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.",3,9,Michael
"Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.",9,20,Andy
"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.",6,19,Michael

Can we have the room please?,5,23,Michael
"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.",4,2,Michael
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.,9,14,Angela
I'm going with grape.,2,13,Jim
"Oh, nothing.",2,14,Jim
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!,3,19,Andy
"I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.",4,14,Jim
It's by the ream?,2,6,Dwight

Did the email go out or…,8,6,Andy
Wow. Oh!,2,22,Jim
We have a gym at home. It’s called the bedroom.,8,9,Phyllis
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.,8,6,Dwight
"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.",8,10,Andy
I'm sorry? Pam.,2,12,Jim
"Really? I don't know. It's a big third date, Jim.",5,4,Michael
It could be kind of funny.,1,4,Dwight
Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!,9,6,Andy
And what happens in this one?,3,18,Jim
"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.",8,24,Andy
"Come on, Michael says we should go now.",6,16,Jim
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.,4,4,Ryan
"Y el accento, donde are you from?",7,4,Dwight
We’re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.,9,22,Phyllis
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.,6,9,Dwight
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!,5,7,Andy
"No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.",3,22,Michael
"No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.",3,17,Jim
"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.",1,4,Jim
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.,3,10,Ryan
"For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.",6,13,Pam
"Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.",5,1,Michael
"OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.",9,4,Jim
Jim. Can I see you for a second?,4,8,Pam
That’s what she said.,9,23,Michael
Gah-ah-hah-ha!,4,6,Dwight
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...,2,22,Michael
"I don't normally do this, but...Girl at table Do what?",6,19,Andy
"Yes, Toby?",2,2,Michael
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.,7,2,Michael
"Hey, I’m in Philadelphia right now.",9,11,Jim
Whoa.,9,12,Kevin
Your home office?,2,9,Pam
It's a miracle. She loves him.,7,8,Pam
This is probably the icebreaker you need.,3,11,Michael
"Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us.",5,24,Phyllis
"Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.",6,19,Michael
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?,6,5,Andy
What’s the mouse’s name?,9,19,Andy

"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",6,18,Michael
That's not how that goes.,6,3,Andy
You're the only person who's congratulated me.,8,2,Andy
"But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?",1,5,Ryan
"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...",7,11,Pam
"You used my move, didn't you?",6,16,Jim
"Oh, did I win the pool?",8,13,Kevin

"Hey, is that healthy food?",5,1,Michael
"I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention.",4,6,Pam
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.,3,13,Michael
"It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was ""Andy,"" ""Problem,"" ""Eliminate,"" something. I don't know what it meant.",6,22,Darryl
David Wallace told me!!Woman from,5,26,Michael

But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor.,7,6,Pam
Are we scaring them straight....?,8,3,Andy
"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",7,6,Michael
"I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.",3,8,Andy
I'll take that down right now.,5,17,Jim

I need you to do something for me.,3,2,Michael

No you're not.,7,22,Dwight
"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",4,5,Jim
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?,5,12,Michael

When was China founded?,7,10,Ryan
"A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?",7,9,Jim
Okay. We fan out...,7,14,Erin
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.,7,1,Jim
"They weren’t really talking that much about money. They just said, We’re good with investing and then I...and I...",9,5,Jim
"Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.",9,18,Dwight

"No I didn't, just please don't...",4,1,Michael
"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",5,13,Pam

"So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?",7,6,Oscar
"Ed Truck.  Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, ""Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work."" What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",2,14,Michael
You are murdering the Nard-dog!,5,20,Andy
"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.",6,9,Michael

Atherozar!,9,3,Dwight
Jinx! Buy me a coke.,2,20,Pam

Angela?,3,13,Pam
"You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",2,17,Michael

"Michael, you have to put your hands down.",6,8,Pam
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?,9,5,Dwight

Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know.

Just always kind of stuck with me.,2,15,Pam

"There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.",4,1,Angela

We're going to ...,3,10,Michael
"All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say ""Boo"" because none of us have ever been to prison.

That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,1,3,Jim
"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",4,5,Michael
"Oh, okay. Don't worry about it.",5,23,Jim

But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.",6,23,Michael

"Nope, I wasn't bitten.",8,16,Dwight
"I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.",8,22,Dwight
Big...,7,8,Michael

"Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?",3,12,Michael

"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, ""Wow, he is so great."" And I was gonna say, ""Well, it's in the genes."" And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew.

"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",6,18,Michael
--that none of us can be a part of--,5,16,Michael

"Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.",7,10,Jim
Sales take a long time.,3,5,Angela
"Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.",5,7,Michael

I said are you ready TO PARTY!,3,6,Andy
With today’s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it’s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.,9,23,Dwight

The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?",7,21,Michael

"Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one  Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?",6,16,Dwight

"I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.",7,11,Pam
...because you are never going to see him again.,3,5,Dwight
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,2,20,Dwight
"I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.",5,20,Michael

Didn't you two date for like a long time?,5,7,Ryan
"The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out.

"Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! Ah OK, now a serious one.",9,4,Andy
Really?,7,11,Michael
"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.",3,21,Michael
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.,4,7,Michael
He did it himself.,8,9,Oscar
"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!",4,3,Dwight
Best Christmas ever.,9,9,Jim

"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",6,10,Andy

I had no idea.,3,20,Andy
"Yes, okay. Bye.",9,13,Jim
With who?,7,15,Angela
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,6,20,Pam
I don't know. That usually works.,7,1,Pam
How far along is Pam?,6,1,Phyllis
What is the matter with you?,4,4,Michael
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day.,5,7,Ryan
Alright.,8,5,Jim
Don't...,3,8,Jim
"Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?",8,4,Jim
I'll take a shirt.,7,7,Michael
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.,5,25,Dwight

"Oh, I'll take 'em.",4,7,Kevin
"Pfft, “Athlead”? Please. They’re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it “Stumpany,” for “Stupid Company.”",9,12,Dwight
I think we're good.,9,18,Angela
"Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...",7,4,Michael

You know what Pam just save it.,7,8,Angela
"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",6,20,Michael
"Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!",7,22,Ryan
"Kevin, move. I can’t pull up the rug if you’re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.",9,11,Oscar
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.,5,20,Dwight
"No, that's Andy's office.",8,19,Jim

Tell them that I'm in a meeting.,7,7,Michael
"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",4,12,Michael
"Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.",2,6,Ryan
"Sometimes we play ""Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?""",2,3,Kevin
Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.,4,3,Darryl
"Okay, I can do that.",9,7,Dwight
"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?",1,6,Jim
"Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!",5,26,Jim

"I don’t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I’ve been faced with a tough decision, there’s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.",9,22,Jim
You don’t like the hats?,8,8,Andy

And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,2,5,Michael
"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left.",5,19,Michael

"Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.",6,13,Michael

"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office.

I'm always this close.,5,8,Jim
"Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",6,16,Pam
"Hey, right?",7,7,Michael
"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!",3,2,Michael

"How so, specifically?",5,11,Michael
Is your wife still your contact?,2,6,Ryan

"People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen ""An Inconvenient Truth"". Nearly twice.",3,19,Andy

You understand? You... you get this check.,3,20,Michael
"It's from ""Sob-ray"", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.",6,14,Michael
Why?,4,4,Michael
"Uhh, I think it's something like umm...",7,10,Pam
It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,3,13,Michael
"STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!",8,4,Dwight

"Wait, are those Michael's Levis?",2,7,Pam

Which on in particular?,7,14,Oscar
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?,4,2,Ryan
Can I drive?,3,7,Dwight

"Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.",5,24,Michael
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,2,11,Jim
"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.",7,23,Jim
Her hair looks beautiful.,9,19,Phyllis

Monkey pee all over you.,6,9,Michael
"Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing – bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese.

Ryan, you ready to do this?",8,17,Dwight
"Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.",3,21,Dwight
We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.,3,10,Dwight

Eight dollars?,7,10,Andy

Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.,9,4,Erin
"Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J.",3,20,Michael

I really hope you get the job.,3,23,Pam
"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",8,10,Andy
You should do more stuff like that.,7,21,Pam
And then you'll be saved.,6,5,Jim
Don't do it,6,18,Dwight
"Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.",6,3,Oscar
I could beat that on a skateboard.,3,8,Dwight
"Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.",6,24,Angela
"Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?",2,21,Dwight
"They do? So, cars are flightless airplanes.",4,2,Jim
"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.",5,1,Jim

"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",7,1,Michael
Do you know the other state?,7,11,Andy
"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.",6,8,Michael
Very easy to clean.,1,6,Michael
"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?",6,4,Dwight
I looked straight at the bag.,5,16,Michael
"I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don’t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.",9,21,Dwight
"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.",3,2,Pam
I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.,5,20,Michael
So embarrassing.,6,23,Pam
"So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...",4,14,Michael
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.",3,11,Michael
"Me, I guess. We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!",8,22,Andy
That's the family boat!,9,6,Andy
"Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.",3,18,Darryl
This is Andy Bernard!,5,7,Andy

We were more than we were.,7,4,Michael
That's him.,1,5,Jim
Cut.,1,2,Dwight
"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.",2,7,Jim
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.,9,23,Pam
Noon.,5,22,Michael
"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...",4,2,Michael
"Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher.",2,19,Michael
Yeah. Oh... oh!,5,4,Michael
"Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do “opportunities.”",9,20,Jim

No. It's gonna be over before you know it.,9,2,Dwight
"Uh, yeah. Should have said so.  Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--",3,20,Andy
I really hope so.,9,17,Dwight
"And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!De",7,20,Dwight
"Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.",4,1,Andy
"Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.",9,10,Erin
I felt terrorized.,7,23,Ryan
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! Sorry.,2,15,Dwight
Dwight!,8,7,Jim
Mmm-hmm.,5,4,Jim
That is impossible. Unless you mean gonorrhea.,4,4,Dwight
"How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?",4,3,Angela
"Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?",6,7,Jim
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting.",4,8,Michael
"Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.",5,5,Kevin
"Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?",4,5,Ryan
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.,8,13,Andy
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.,6,6,Jim
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?,6,16,Angela
"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.",5,16,Michael
How's it hanging?,5,18,Dwight

More Tylenol.,7,16,Michael

"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.",8,3,Pam
We'll look into it.,9,18,Jim
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?,5,3,Jim
"Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.",8,10,Andy
"Ah, they moved the shower.",5,1,Jim
Why don't we just go by ourselves?,4,2,Jim
He is.,5,13,Dwight
"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw ""congratulations"" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.",4,14,Pam
He's not my client.,4,13,Kevin
"Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!",8,18,Dwight
Bah…I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.,8,2,Andy
"Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!",1,5,Michael
"Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....",8,1,Dwight
They had no yams.,2,12,Ryan
Sometimes you over react.,7,17,Ryan
That you are afraid.,2,22,Michael
"Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.",6,18,Phyllis
"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...",4,12,Jim
I can protect you from Kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously.,6,21,Dwight
"Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don’t you just take estrogen?  There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah.",8,23,Dwight
"When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-",7,5,Michael
"Okay. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",7,16,Michael
Who do you think it should be?,2,5,Michael

"Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.",7,20,Pam
Chapter seven The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.,8,4,Jim
"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",8,3,Jim
"Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel.",3,19,Michael
"This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.",3,21,Kevin
Dancing babies!,4,5,Phyllis
Thank you.,4,5,Pam
"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",1,3,Michael
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?,2,16,Dwight
Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.Nail manager No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.,9,15,Oscar
"Little trouble. Yes. Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",4,9,Michael
"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'",5,17,Andy
OK.JIM9334  Let's meet for lunch.,5,1,Jim
What was this?,2,22,Jim

I don't take any prescription drugs.,2,20,Angela

"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",9,15,Pam
"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? Let's give this a shot.",5,13,Michael
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?,5,15,Jim
"Yes, definitely.",6,2,Michael

"No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.",7,3,Michael

"Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind.",2,17,Jim
Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.,3,10,Jim
Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?,5,24,Dwight
Okay.,6,23,Michael
"Oh, man, I’d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.",8,23,Jim
Let's get back together.,3,23,Michael
"No, I'm serious. There's always something better.",9,3,Jim
"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",2,15,Pam
Really? Why?,8,12,Jim
"Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.",5,17,Kevin
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.,5,22,Andy
"Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.",9,23,Angela
That's like...,2,11,Michael
"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.",6,5,Michael
People say you cry all the time.,6,4,Erin

"Come on in.  That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",6,3,Dwight
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window.,8,3,Oscar
Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...,5,13,Kevin
"Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.",7,9,Ryan
"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.",9,15,Andy
"Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-",2,9,Michael
Okay. It's going to be great.,5,19,Michael
I wish I could hire all of you.,9,13,Dwight
"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",2,5,Michael
"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.",8,18,Darryl
Admit what?,7,2,Pam
"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?",7,24,Jim
"Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye.",2,14,Jim
"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, ""world's longest engagement"", um, we're all expecting it, you know?",2,1,Jim
But you work tomorrow.,9,9,Dwight
Congratulations. That's great.,6,16,Oscar
"No, no, no.",7,13,Michael
Oh yeah I bet.,5,21,Pam
"Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.",3,19,Dwight
"Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.",1,5,Michael
It's beautiful.,5,9,Angela
"So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get ""longest engagement"" this year.",2,1,Kevin
I’m on the phone. I’m on the phone.,9,13,Jim
"Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?",3,23,Jim
"No. Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.",5,20,Jim

Go get him Bobby!,4,1,Phyllis
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.,6,21,Michael
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.,2,16,Michael
"No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.",3,23,Pam
I get it.,6,19,Erin
"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.",6,7,Dwight
Eel fishing.,6,22,Dwight
But that would make more sense.,8,5,Jim
I'm not single.,4,11,Jim
All right! Thank you!,3,5,Michael
"These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---",2,18,Dwight
"Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.",4,14,Jim
It could've died of natural causes. So...,6,7,Michael
"That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",2,21,Pam
"Oh geeze. . Oh, my God!",9,23,Angela
Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,4,2,Michael
"It's just so dumb. But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...",8,21,Pam
For what purpose?,2,20,Dwight
What's this? What is this?,2,16,Dwight
"Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...",2,1,Dwight
"Well, he's Florida's problem now.",8,18,Jim
This is kinda time sensitive.,8,3,Andy
I looked at the bag.,5,16,Michael
Cool. Bye.,5,16,Kevin
Take. That down.,5,5,Andy
Oh.,3,17,Jim
Let me call you back.,8,2,Oscar
"Oh, you don't know her.",4,10,Jim
"Yeah, you should.",3,18,Darryl
"Let him expense it, Dwight.",8,1,Oscar
"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No.",2,9,Michael
Big tip.,7,15,Jim
"Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",5,8,Michael
"Great, then it doesn't matter.",5,5,Angela
That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.,6,4,Phyllis
"I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.",6,19,Andy
Sorry.,1,2,Pam
Ok. Andy &,6,14,Andy

"Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.",8,7,Ryan
Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast.,3,7,Michael
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner. She wants you to call her.,4,2,Pam
Okay.,6,18,Michael
"Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.",7,12,Michael
I didn't-,5,9,Angela
"OK, it stopped.",3,21,Michael
You haven't even introduced yourself.,6,22,Darryl
Yeah.,2,17,Michael
"Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... What?",5,11,Kevin
"No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.",3,21,Jim
I'll just throw out some suggestions.,2,9,Michael
Is there internet?,6,10,Ryan
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,3,5,Andy
"So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.",9,3,Andy
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,6,8,Pam
"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it!",4,14,Michael
"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that’s only gonna make things worse.",9,13,Jim
"I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?",2,8,Dwight
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. Right? Would you agree with that?,6,13,Michael
"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?",5,9,Andy
"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",2,11,Jim
Which one's yours?,2,3,Dwight
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.,8,6,Andy
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?,8,24,Phyllis
"Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.",1,4,Michael
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-,6,7,Andy
Ok Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.,8,7,Pam
You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.,2,12,Michael
"It's still happening right now actually, so uh...",9,10,Jim
Who?,3,9,Michael
"Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.",5,4,Michael
"Oh, queer... eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",2,6,Michael
"Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.",5,24,Michael
Good question.,2,12,Michael
"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.",3,3,Dwight
"There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.",1,4,Michael
No... no. One crisis at a time.,3,16,Dwight
"What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?",8,10,Oscar
It's true.,5,17,Dwight
"I just really, really think we should handle this internally.",7,23,Dwight
Movie idea?,7,15,Dwight

What did you guys talk about?,2,13,Pam
"Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.",2,4,Dwight
"Andy, I care about you and I think--",8,19,Erin
Dwight is our new boss.,3,23,Phyllis
"That is so good, Michael",2,20,Kevin
"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",2,9,Dwight
"Ooh, gosh!",8,7,Andy
"Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?",2,8,Dwight
Can I address that?,5,24,Jim
You wanted to have sex in my office.,7,15,Ryan
We have to put an end to this.,5,11,Michael
"Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact.",2,6,Michael
"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",5,17,Jim
What kind of prank are you thinking?,4,3,Pam
"I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.",7,3,Michael
"There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. ""I'm coming over baby."" And I would text back ""BTB"", bring that booty.",7,10,Darryl
You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.,4,4,Michael
I need you to perform a test.,9,22,Dwight
Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.,6,5,Kevin
Hey.,2,11,Jim
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?,6,1,Andy
"This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,",2,3,Michael
Tonight's so...,5,4,Michael
"Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-",2,1,Michael
Is who a Michael what?,4,10,Michael
Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!,3,11,Dwight
Vaccines are for chumps!,4,2,Dwight
I can't hear you through the glass,5,11,Andy
It's only twenty-five bucks.,2,8,Dwight
Wait. This says “Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge”?,9,12,Phyllis
"Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.Dwight, Jim and",6,16,Jim
It's that I wish Jessica was dead.,8,10,Erin
"You’re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.",8,17,Jim
It's gonna be OK.,4,1,Pam
"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.",2,11,Dwight
"Josh Porter, high five. Bam.",2,16,Michael
Ow! Get off! Get off!,6,1,Andy
Nope. The opposite of that.,2,16,Michael
Why don't you talk to him about it?,7,22,Pam
"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",2,3,Michael
"Hey, boss man.",6,19,Andy
"Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.",7,11,Andy
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.,8,3,Pam
"Well, technically FOR Andy.",8,4,Andy
"I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.",3,10,Ryan
"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.",6,23,Michael
No. Do you?,2,12,Michael
500 and one penny.,5,4,Dwight
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?,4,4,Ryan
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.,3,2,Angela
"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.",6,4,Michael
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.,5,19,Pam
Hey hey hey hey. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.,4,9,Dwight
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.,3,9,Andy
"Don't patronize me, Pam.",5,20,Michael
"Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That’d be fun.",9,21,Erin
Engaging wings,5,7,Andy
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...,1,5,Pam
"Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.",7,22,Kevin
"All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.",7,15,Jim
"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",2,21,Jim
"Meredith, I-",7,5,Oscar
"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, ""That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..."" I dunno, it's a good feeling.",4,12,Michael
"I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.",3,1,Oscar
"Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",4,7,Michael
Right.,3,8,Jim
"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",4,12,Michael
Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?,6,11,Michael
"Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?",7,7,Erin
This is what we know.,3,21,Dwight
"Couple minutes, give or take.",4,7,Pam
"Get upstairs, mister!",9,22,Erin
I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?,6,4,Dwight
That's my stopwatch.,2,3,Dwight
He is black... right? And...,3,9,Kevin
"Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don’t see them so I think we’re good.",9,8,Dwight
That was never agreed upon.,8,7,Darryl
"Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.",2,14,Ryan
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.,4,14,Pam
"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.",4,4,Michael
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,4,2,Dwight
That's really good.,5,7,Andy
"Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.",2,4,Dwight
Kaaw!,5,8,Andy
I look forward to it.,6,16,Angela
"Your turn, Stanley. Angela, you're up.",2,20,Dwight
"On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.",2,19,Michael
"Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.",2,9,Jim
Fine.,5,2,Dwight
...it happens once every billion years.,2,1,Michael
"I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.",3,22,Dwight
"Eh, a little bit.",8,13,Ryan
What did I write?,2,21,Jim
"Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?",7,7,Dwight
"The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre  to the power of two.",8,18,Dwight
Aren't they magnificent?,6,4,Dwight
"It just-  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...",4,6,Pam
I think it's gonna be Michael.,3,23,Phyllis
Any other questions? Kelly Kapoor.,4,2,Ryan
"Just go out, and come back in.",4,6,Michael
"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",7,20,Jim
"Nothing, Kevin.",1,3,Angela
I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.De,7,21,Andy
"I know, I know that you're proud of me.",8,4,Andy
"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.",4,1,Michael
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.,9,21,Pam
"Hey, uh David.",6,11,Jim
Careful. There is no inner circle.,7,22,Jim
It's my own fault-,7,3,Jim
"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",9,16,Andy
"You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.",8,10,Phyllis
"Jim, you have high blood pressure.",8,7,Pam
"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",6,22,Michael
Try this one.,9,11,Oscar
Yeah I’m serious.,8,5,Dwight
They came up with that idea really fast.,5,5,Pam
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.,6,22,Andy
"I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!",6,16,Michael
I don't think those were yours to take.,6,23,Pam
"Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I’ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--",9,8,Dwight
That is ridiculous.,2,4,Michael
How could we do what?,6,12,Pam
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.,2,4,Michael
Don't answer it.,3,21,Pam
"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.",4,5,Jim
Can we have another? I think I blinked.,5,5,Michael
"No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.",4,11,Ryan
What about the surprise?,1,3,Angela
I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.,3,23,Dwight
"Well, you didn't even hear it.",6,11,Michael
Acrimonious.,3,22,Michael
Why do you doubt that she’s single?,8,7,Pam
"Come on, Dwight.",7,3,Angela
"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",3,8,Andy
You know what? I-- I-- I don’t think you want to start a conversation with me about what’s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --,9,12,Pam
"All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?",7,12,Kevin
Jan? What's new?,5,3,Kevin
"Yes, it's Eddie.",4,11,Andy
Mind control.,2,22,Jim
"Andy wait! Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I’m sorry.",8,19,Erin
"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.",9,14,Pam
I can't believe how bad this looks.,5,14,Jim
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.,7,5,Jim
"Angela, you like lacrosse?",4,4,Andy
That is a lot of liquor.,3,2,Jim
"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",1,3,Dwight
An Altima or better.,9,1,Jim
"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!",2,2,Michael
"Oh, um... .I can't.",2,9,Jim
You really want to do this?,9,23,Jim
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.,3,12,Dwight
No.,5,4,Michael
You know what this is? This is a stinger.,7,5,Michael
"Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?",6,16,Michael
I'll do it.,2,3,Phyllis
"You cannot say ""I was raped"" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.",5,6,Michael
I know. And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing? How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?,5,4,Pam
"You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -",5,20,Pam
I need to know if I can start the party?,3,10,Angela
"Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?",1,4,Dwight
How would we know that?,5,21,Pam
"Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.",4,13,Jim
What are you mumbling about?,5,6,Dwight
Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.,6,7,Andy
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.,2,15,Angela
You were laughing right?,7,20,Michael
"No, copier's great.",5,9,Pam
A fairy princess. You're very... .,2,5,Michael
"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.",9,14,Jim
Outside my car in two minutes.,7,8,Angela
"Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at-- okay, that's... All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",6,23,Michael
What is first base with Angela?,5,7,Oscar
"Well, that didn't go well.",2,17,Dwight
I would love to.,1,6,Ryan
"Oh, god, this again? You’re Stinky.",9,11,Dwight
Black widow.,6,7,Angela
"Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?",2,13,Michael
During our relaxation exercise?,5,13,Michael
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.",9,4,Andy
"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?",2,8,Michael
Michael... am I gay?,6,1,Andy
"Hey, Kenny.",3,16,Pam
She's not playing the game.,2,7,Michael
"Okay, sounds great.",2,22,Michael
"Come on, folks!",5,26,Dwight
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,1,3,Dwight
"Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  Hey Pam.",5,23,Michael
"I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.",2,12,Jim
I think it's called 'Nibbles'.,9,17,Pam
You can have your snack in here.,3,10,Pam
Yeah!,2,22,Michael
"Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.",6,6,Erin
Tuna.,4,7,Andy
What's that cooler?,9,14,Jim
"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?",5,24,Dwight
I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.,7,18,Jim
Well... you look great.,4,2,Ryan
"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.",1,1,Michael
"D, it’s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.",9,23,Angela
"Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.",7,6,Dwight
"I am going in there! Don’t—Check-in guy No, you’re not, sir.",9,22,Andy
"Here it is, you should draw a picture...",4,12,Andy
"There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.",3,23,Michael
I have nothing in common with Plop.,9,1,Jim
You didn't have any.,2,12,Pam
Let's start with the wildcard.,5,4,Jim
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.,5,12,Michael
"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.",7,17,Michael
What flavors did you get?,6,23,Pam
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?,4,3,Kevin
Gabe!,7,21,Erin
"It was an amateur production, technically.",7,3,Oscar
"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",6,22,Dwight
I'm just curious.,1,2,Oscar
Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.,8,8,Oscar
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.,7,13,Ryan
Good in bed.,6,22,Michael
Yeah? You like it?,8,11,Andy
Anything. You can ask me anything.,5,7,Andy
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.,7,1,Jim
"It would look good, on my mantle.",6,11,Michael
"So, next interview has to be better.",9,16,Jim
"Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.",2,1,Michael
Is she crazy in bed?,5,11,Michael
I got it here.,2,20,Dwight
I stole this. For you babe.,4,9,Jim
"""Seriously?"" Are you serious?",6,12,Andy
"What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?",6,6,Pam
You sound tired. Everything ok?,9,10,Jim
"Congratulations, baby!",9,2,Darryl
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.,6,1,Michael
Umm... it was not that long ago.,2,7,Pam
"That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.",9,6,Oscar
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.,3,8,Phyllis
"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",8,13,Jim
There's 800 of them!,3,22,Pam
"No, I....",5,21,Jim
We have a little song prepared for you.,6,14,Michael
This is too good.,3,18,Darryl
"Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. What is this? Oh, god. Henry.",9,17,Dwight
We thought that she was you.,6,2,Dwight
"I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?",5,5,Andy
"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",7,19,Dwight
I don't follow.,2,17,Dwight
"The note. So ""holier than thou"".",5,8,Oscar
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.,6,5,Michael
But I'm the Godfather.,7,7,Michael
Maybe. One step at a time.,5,15,Pam
"I once saw a movie called ""Training Day"". It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.",3,5,Dwight
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.,2,2,Pam
"Um, I am a little busy.",8,23,Pam
"There’s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.",9,5,Jim
Is it for the bird?,3,4,Pam
That's what she said.,3,17,Michael
"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",4,12,Dwight
"Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.",4,7,Andy
I have a hoop in my driveway.,1,5,Kevin
What is your type?,1,6,Kevin
"It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.",6,17,Michael
Got it.,5,13,Dwight
Yep. Lucked out.,7,17,Pam
Can you put that down there?,2,18,Angela
"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.",6,17,Dwight
"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -",6,10,Michael
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.,3,11,Ryan
Do you mean Neverland?,2,6,Ryan
Yes.,6,24,Michael
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?",8,15,Dwight
"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",2,20,Dwight
"Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?",4,11,Dwight
"Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?",8,3,Jim
Very official.,3,6,Pam
"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, ""Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you."" His words.",4,2,Michael
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.,9,3,Jim
You're welcome.,2,13,Michael
"I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.",7,7,Ryan
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.,3,12,Dwight
...ces.,3,4,Kevin
I sa-,5,11,Dwight
"Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.",7,9,Pam
Because of how much Angela hates it.,2,3,Kevin
United front...,7,17,Pam
"No, I really don't want to.",2,11,Jim
No. She's an alternate.,3,23,Michael
"I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.",1,1,Michael
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?,7,2,Michael
"Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.",3,3,Pam
"Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.",9,6,Andy
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.,4,3,Dwight
How do you live with a franchise this bad?,4,12,Ryan
"Oh, OK. Girl in",4,11,Michael
Exactly.,5,25,Michael
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,8,14,Dwight
I don't know.,3,18,Pam
We think you might kill Robert.,8,22,Angela
I can't do this.,5,8,Ryan
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!,8,22,Jim
Count me in!,4,13,Andy
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.,5,18,Michael
Sign it.,6,3,Dwight
"Michael, you were expecting me, right?",5,20,Pam
"These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say ""I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow."" Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.",5,16,Michael
"Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.",7,2,Pam
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.,8,14,Andy
"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",5,5,Andy
"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.",2,16,Michael
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,2,17,Dwight
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,6,3,Michael
"Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",2,18,Michael
"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.",4,10,Dwight
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.,7,24,Darryl
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,6,14,Pam
"Uh, hmm. Uh, hmm. What else?",3,23,Jim
"You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!abe Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes.",7,21,Erin
"Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.",3,12,Angela
"Oh, who else is going?",7,3,Erin
Stop moving!,8,15,Dwight
Creed did you organize the menu book?,2,13,Ryan
"Look, It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.",7,4,Michael
You already did me.,2,21,Angela
"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?",3,9,Jim
"Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.",3,10,Pam
I do understand it.,6,18,Michael
"Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.",7,5,Dwight
Michael!,5,22,Pam
Good morning.Female church member Good morning.,7,7,Michael
Didn't you two used to do it?,9,16,Kevin
Come on! Phyllis!,6,12,Michael
Wait. Seriously?,7,5,Andy
"Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.Pizza guy You better think about what you're doing.",4,3,Michael
"Yeah, I've been sayin that.",2,12,Michael
They have no idea what happened.,6,5,Kevin
"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",2,22,Michael

You think I don’t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I’ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne’er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don’t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.,9,5,Dwight
"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",2,21,Michael
"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. Hello?",4,14,Dwight

"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",3,12,Andy

"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.",6,6,Michael
"No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.",6,1,Andy
What's going on? Anything here?,2,14,Michael

"No, not taller this way, taller this way.",9,8,Kevin
...And products!,3,16,Michael
Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That’s what you did with this trip.,8,8,Andy

It doesn't make any sense.,5,9,Dwight
"Sure. Meredith, do you mind?",4,14,Pam

So I guess I can assume that was personal.,5,2,Jim
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,4,2,Jim
"Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying ""Dunder Mifflin"" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?",5,19,Michael
"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",2,10,Michael

I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!,8,22,Oscar
"I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.",5,22,Michael
You owe me and apology.,6,4,Oscar
Ok.,2,7,Michael

Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?,3,17,Michael
"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says ""You wanted me"" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.",5,21,Jim
"Oh, are those your kids? They’re so cute! They could be models.",9,7,Phyllis

"What I’m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I’ve ever said.",9,22,Jim
"Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.",2,4,Dwight
"That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.",6,6,Michael
I know. I could just bang you right now.,8,12,Dwight

"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.",5,18,Michael
What? Sorry.,5,3,Andy
"Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet. It's, it's kind of unique. It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese. And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing. You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth. I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore. Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg I know, I know! But you know what? It's perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what? Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing. The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.",2,7,Michael
Don't. I have information about the sex predator.,3,21,Jim

You've got to tell Andy about us.,5,11,Dwight
"Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!HCT",9,5,Andy
"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",4,12,Dwight
You'll never guess what I know.,6,1,Michael
Who is your emergency contact?,2,6,Ryan
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?,7,9,Jim
"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.",4,6,Jim
"I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.",4,1,Pam
What don't you get?,5,4,Phyllis
T-bag bone…,8,2,Andy

"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?",5,21,Jim

"But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.",7,13,Andy
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.,5,7,Michael
"Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.",5,15,Jim
"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?",3,22,Dwight
Did you see...,3,18,Phyllis
Oooh! You can't handle the truth!,7,6,Jim
"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",1,1,Michael

We have discount prices on ink cartridges...,3,12,Jim
"I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.",5,18,Michael
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,5,8,Pam
Okay.,7,3,Michael
"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.",4,7,Michael
This is what I was trying to tell you.,8,21,Andy
Do you remember what color my eyes are?,4,11,Michael

"Oh, don't be that person.",3,19,Jim
"Hey, you caught some of that?",8,7,Darryl
"Swear to God, hope to die. Now let’s get to work!",8,2,Andy
"The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. They didn't eat the children.",2,18,Dwight
I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.,6,6,Pam

"You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?",1,6,Ryan
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.,5,24,Michael
I have plans later.,4,4,Darryl
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.,3,5,Dwight
"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.",6,8,Dwight
"No, I’m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.",9,5,Erin
"435. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?",6,16,Michael

"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical.

What are you- You're here early.,9,20,Dwight
"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?",3,10,Michael
How about July 4th weekend?,6,17,Michael
"The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",2,1,Jim
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,7,11,Dwight

I don't like you.,2,21,Phyllis
You know what the problem is?,2,9,Michael
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?,7,3,Dwight
"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. ""Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority."" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",2,6,Michael
"She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.Mary-",2,9,Michael
Hum.,2,3,Jim
"Wow, can we make it a different moment?",4,3,Jim

"Life hacking, man.",9,3,Darryl
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.,8,6,Andy
"Okay, Penguin.",3,8,Kevin
"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",8,13,Jim
Wh--what are you doing?,5,24,Dwight
Toilets!,9,2,Pam
"Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.",7,9,Erin

"Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  Come in.",6,2,Michael
"No, they stopped making that show.",2,22,Pam
"So how does it work? It’s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or…",9,19,Jim
"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",6,16,Pam
"Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?",2,8,Jim
"Andy, what's the problem?",7,13,Michael
"I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.",7,7,Pam
Does it have a deck?,2,3,Dwight
"...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.",2,3,Michael
Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.,9,7,Oscar
"You know, you have worked so hard for this. You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.",2,9,Dwight
I was in love with you.,7,15,Michael
But I got all the foot off of it.,3,14,Michael
It's only Meredith.,4,1,Dwight
Here we are.,2,10,Michael
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.,5,5,Pam
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.,2,4,Dwight
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,6,5,Michael
"Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?",8,17,Jim
"Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.",1,6,Michael
"Yeah, so there you go.",5,6,Michael
"Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-",7,24,Angela
"Okay, I'm turning it off.",8,11,Ryan
"Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.",3,23,Jim
"Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-",6,9,Jim
"It’s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I’m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I’ll just go downstairs.",9,8,Oscar
Seriously?,9,21,Andy
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.,7,6,Ryan
Then we meet at the Denny's...,5,12,Dwight
Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. PAM!,3,21,Dwight
"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.",7,1,Andy
"You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.",5,5,Dwight
You know she has it out for him now.,3,3,Angela
Nope. No dog video.,8,1,Jim
Maybe!,2,14,Michael
Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.,9,15,Dwight

Tell me about the cologne. How much?,9,16,Jim
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,5,17,Pam
"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",8,8,Dwight
It's lovely.,6,14,Pam
You know.,2,3,Michael
I'm not firing anyone.,3,3,Michael
"No, Michael.",3,2,Pam
"Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.",7,12,Michael
Whassup!,1,1,Michael
I’m not wearing eyeliner.,8,17,Jim
"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.",4,7,Jim
"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",6,3,Michael
Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!,6,10,Michael

"No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.",6,19,Michael
You're being gross.,4,4,Pam
"I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono.",3,18,Dwight
"All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.",1,2,Michael
"Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please.  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---Michael and",2,9,Michael
I'm putting my bed right over here.,2,3,Michael

Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.,1,3,Michael
I didn't get any agenda.,1,1,Michael
"I don't... okay, just listen.",2,5,Michael
"Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.",3,16,Michael
"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",8,7,Pam
"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.",4,6,Michael
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,5,13,Dwight
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,2,13,Jim
"Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?",2,1,Michael
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,6,16,Pam
Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.,9,3,Andy
Do you want me to ask where you're going?,4,7,Pam

I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...,3,6,Andy
We're getting married today.,5,25,Pam
"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted ""We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.",8,6,Dwight
"Alright. I'll call you, kid.",6,16,Dwight
So I'll see you guys around!,5,21,Erin
"Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.",6,19,Phyllis
It's either taping or calling.Andy &,8,4,Erin

Sexually?,5,14,Phyllis
Yes I am.,5,19,Michael
"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",2,8,Dwight
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.,8,3,Darryl
"Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.",2,3,Michael
Oh... kay.,2,18,Michael
"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.",3,9,Jim
"Aye, aye, Cap'n.",3,21,Andy
"No, I think you're gonna stay.",2,19,Michael
Happy birthday Michael.,2,19,Pam
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.,5,25,Dwight
"He’s like a manatee. Ready? Let’s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.",9,19,Dwight
"Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.",8,12,Erin
Cherokee Jack.,7,16,Michael
"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",4,6,Michael
"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",2,2,Michael
Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?,3,15,Michael
How's it going down there?,2,15,Pam
Be careful. Oh no!! Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!,3,15,Michael
See these forms...,9,6,Jim
"No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.",7,19,Michael
"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.",6,24,Michael
I think there's better...,7,13,Pam
"Come on, break this up.",2,16,Dwight
"Oh, she is hot.",5,12,Michael
More Dundies!Pam and,2,1,Pam
"You know what? I don’t know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don’t even recognize them.",9,8,Phyllis
"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.",3,2,Dwight
"Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?",6,16,Michael
"Hi, here you can have this. It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.",1,6,Dwight
"Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!",5,11,Dwight
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.,2,4,Jim
All right.,6,22,Michael
Is it a bird?,2,14,Michael
Cool.,2,16,Pam
"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.",5,17,Jim
"Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady.",4,10,Michael
"Pam, it just happened.",6,4,Jim
And a soy sauce packet.,7,2,Pam
Temporary workspace. You can use it.,1,3,Michael
"It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.",6,18,Angela
"Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.",6,16,Michael
"Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.",8,8,Jim
"Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.",6,16,Pam
Ugh.,9,16,Angela
"We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.",7,2,Jim
"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?",2,3,Jim
Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.,4,3,Dwight
Did you tell them?,6,19,Andy
"Um, just something somebody wrote.",2,1,Pam
I...,2,8,Michael
Don’t care. Tell me later.,8,17,Andy
"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",8,10,Jim
I love working here and I do not want to leave.,5,17,Dwight
"Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.",2,14,Michael
"Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.",3,14,Michael
The pressures of my office are insane.,2,14,Michael
"I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",3,4,Pam
Yeah?,2,14,Michael
"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",4,12,Michael
"I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that.",9,21,Jim
How about now?,5,16,Dwight
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?,3,6,Angela
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.,5,26,Jim
"So…what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?",8,23,Pam
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.,8,13,Kevin
My plan-- a man-- panama.,6,3,Michael
Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,8,7,Pam
"Ooh, that sounds great.",8,4,Andy
Boring.,2,9,Michael
My new girlfriend.,3,10,Andy
"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?",7,10,Jim
As a human being.,2,8,Pam
Let's get the party started.,2,19,Dwight
"OK, everybody just calm down.",6,9,Dwight
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?,6,20,Oscar
AIDS.,2,22,Michael
"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.",4,3,Pam
"No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.",6,16,Dwight
"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. What the hell is going on back there?",6,17,Michael
"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.",5,3,Michael
Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.,4,13,Michael
You all right Ryan?,2,17,Michael
"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.",2,5,Michael
Up she goes!,9,6,Andy
We can relax.,7,3,Pam
"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",2,15,Michael
"Oh, they're my client.",5,23,Jim
"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",2,6,Dwight
You said you would be there for me.,9,8,Angela
"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--",6,4,Jim
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...,6,24,Pam
"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.",3,22,Dwight
Yes?Hospital employee Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.,6,16,Pam
"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?",7,10,Jim
"He totally misses,",2,13,Dwight
"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...Ad guy 1 That all sounds really, really ambitious.",4,5,Michael
I take it back!,2,4,Pam
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,7,11,Michael
Has to be done. We'll press send together.,5,7,Ryan
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order.,2,8,Ryan
Affirmative.,1,6,Michael
It's nice to learn new things.,5,4,Phyllis
Yeah he does.,8,20,Pam
"Michael, you did all this?",6,8,Pam
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.,7,4,Phyllis
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.,8,6,Dwight
"Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?",2,3,Michael
"Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.",5,12,Michael
Look at this.,7,11,Pam
"Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice.",9,20,Pam
See you.,6,11,Jim
"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",9,15,Andy
Congratulations.,6,8,Michael
"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",4,13,Michael
"All right, yes.",5,9,Michael
Amen.,7,23,Angela
I ain’t fraid of no ghost. Whoa!,8,5,Jim
He got scented candles!,6,12,Kevin
"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?",6,16,Jim
We get it.,4,11,Angela
Ow! God!,3,4,Dwight
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?,9,18,Pam
"Try again… Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one… is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?",8,16,Dwight
It doesn't make any sense.,2,7,Dwight
"Um... Sadiq (IT guy) About my turban, maybe?",2,9,Michael
Three queens.,2,22,Kevin
"Yep, never been used.",4,9,Michael
Sorry Andy.,7,17,Pam
"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",5,9,Michael
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We’ll come back to visit. But I think it’s time for us to officially…,9,23,Pam
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!,3,10,Angela
Why is that secret?,2,6,Ryan
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.,4,14,Kevin
"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",2,11,Michael
"I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.",6,12,Michael
"To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever.",3,14,Michael
The only Santa.,6,12,Phyllis
"Yeah, I want to go home.",6,9,Jim
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,5,17,Michael
Ashley! You made it!,5,25,Erin
"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.",5,9,Jim
"We tell them the plan, right?",6,10,Michael
Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.,9,4,Pam
"There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?",4,6,Dwight
"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",6,12,Michael
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku.,7,15,Andy
"Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?",7,23,Dwight
"More of a, barbaric growl.",9,3,Dwight
"You can do it, just say it.De",7,20,Michael
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,2,21,Michael
Mmhm!,7,6,Michael
It's like The Hurt Locker!,7,3,Jim
"And now, the chains.",3,17,Michael
Ehh.,6,21,Andy
"See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",6,19,Michael
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.,8,10,Andy
"Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?",9,2,Angela
"Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.",4,7,Kevin
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!,3,9,Pam
"Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.",5,6,Andy
"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",1,3,Dwight
"Jimbo, let's do this thang.",5,6,Michael
"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...",6,3,Jim
"Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.",1,3,Michael
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?,4,10,Pam
"Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!",4,4,Dwight
I wanna do this.,9,23,Pam
Why is she marrying Andy?,5,4,Dwight
"Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.",1,5,Michael
I miss that.,3,1,Jim
"Here's the thing. When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",4,7,Pam
"If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.",7,13,Andy
"Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?",6,4,Pam
"Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.",6,20,Kevin
Oh my God! That's it! That's it!,7,12,Michael
"Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.",8,22,Angela
"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.",2,3,Dwight
"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?",7,3,Andy
"C'mon Jim, let's go.",3,10,Michael
"Oh, man, it's really back there.",2,13,Dwight
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.,8,6,Andy
Clearly that's what you wanted.,5,18,Michael
"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? This is the reason we're here.",4,1,Michael
"Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It’s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.",9,22,Kevin
"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? ""Raging Bull."" Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag.",2,6,Michael
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,6,10,Pam
What’s a book?,8,17,Dwight
"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",7,5,Michael
"Sorry about kicking you out. It’s just, we don’t want our brand associated with death.",8,17,Erin
"I know, I know.",7,4,Michael
... customer service is a Hindu person.,3,6,Michael
"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?",3,11,Jim
What was?,5,6,Jim
Matt?,6,12,Pam
"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.",5,9,Jim
I got goose bumps.,3,10,Pam
"Really playing the scales, huh?",9,15,Erin
One order.,8,16,Kevin
"Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?",9,22,Jim
Gahhh. That's five strikes.,8,6,Andy
Call you right back. What were you saying?,9,16,Jim
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.,2,13,Michael
That's all right.,3,2,Jim
"We're gonna miss you, Gabe.",7,24,Dwight
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?,3,23,Jim
We don't tell her.,7,24,Kevin
"Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.",2,7,Michael
"Oh, but you didn't.",5,23,Jim
Recyclops will have his revenge.,6,10,Dwight
You don't have a toothbrush?,8,19,Andy
I think I heard it on Roy's side.,3,17,Ryan
"Erin, do we have the journal?",6,9,Michael
"Wow, that is delicious.",5,10,Jim
"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! You suck. Alright, who’s next? Darryl?",9,1,Andy
"Zip it, Meredith.",7,11,Angela
Have you seen it?,2,3,Dwight
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.,9,16,Andy
"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.",4,2,Michael
"No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.",4,4,Angela
"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",6,10,Michael
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? I don't care.,7,10,Michael
"But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?",6,3,Angela
"Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",8,12,Jim
What are you talking about?,8,8,Jim
Does it have a deck?,2,3,Dwight
Give the bottle to Michael,2,12,Jim
I didn't order anything.,7,17,Dwight
"Yes, your corner. Go.",2,2,Michael
"Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...",6,1,Oscar
"Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.",2,17,Ryan
I'm not answering that. You answer it.,5,17,Dwight
My calls?,9,1,Dwight
Are you really gonna marry him?  ...Ok.,3,1,Jim
"Mm, it's not that big.",3,18,Darryl
You are welcome.,4,11,Michael
"Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. Shh...",5,7,Andy
"All right, what'd you do?",7,14,Pam
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,6,1,Jim
Sorry if your special night was ruined.,8,12,Erin
I don't approve. I don't.,3,3,Angela
"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?",4,11,Jim
Jim!,9,9,Pam
"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.",5,22,Andy
No...,3,6,Michael
"Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?",5,19,Oscar
Are you avoiding your phone call?,9,8,Pam
It won't.,4,4,Michael
"What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.",5,25,Michael
"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what...",4,7,Michael
"Per mile, yes.",1,4,Michael
"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.",8,12,Andy
"I haven't signed them, ok?",2,6,Michael
"Oh, my gosh.",6,16,Pam
"No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!",3,1,Oscar
How we doing on time?,4,3,Michael
"Dwight, get away!",6,16,Pam
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.,8,7,Darryl
"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That's a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",7,24,Dwight
Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?,6,20,Dwight
"David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.",5,11,Michael
That was a really sucky thing to do.,5,7,Michael
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.,5,1,Dwight
Don't vaccinate it.,6,1,Ryan
I don't get to wear my ties.,3,13,Dwight
"I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.",9,6,Kevin
What did you say?,8,8,Andy
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,5,10,Pam
"2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.",5,1,Darryl
Totally. George Clooney.,9,2,Kevin
"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.",6,2,Dwight
"Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years.",2,3,Jim
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-,8,3,Dwight
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.,7,11,Angela
. Get out of my way.,9,23,Dwight
"'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?",3,15,Dwight
Don't eat it.,7,23,Kevin
OK.Mr.,1,2,Michael
"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird.",8,6,Andy
That must have been hard.,2,15,Phyllis
Space dust.,9,18,Jim
"I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.",5,25,Andy
"Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.",3,22,Pam
"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.",7,1,Michael
Oh-,2,8,Jim
"No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.",8,18,Darryl
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.,7,5,Phyllis
Scuse me! Scuse me!Andy &,3,8,Michael
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.,9,9,Dwight
Hey.,8,7,Jim
Are you kidding me?,7,8,Michael
"Listen, I know you really like Ryan--",7,9,Pam
Are we gonna do it?,2,3,Michael
"Well, what if I just do this?",5,24,Jim
I have to go to the bathroom!,9,6,Kevin
These cookies are fine.,7,11,Andy
"Um, I was at another dumpster!",6,15,Ryan
"Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.",4,4,Jim
And tolerance.Mr.,1,2,Michael
"It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...",9,7,Jim
"Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.",4,1,Pam
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,4,10,Michael
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.,3,22,Oscar
"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",1,4,Dwight
"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",9,13,Jim
"Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. ""Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?"" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.",3,21,Michael
"Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.",3,11,Phyllis
But you can leave your arm.,9,9,Erin
Yes?,6,9,Michael
"All right, my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.",4,9,Michael
"Uh, fun jeans.",3,2,Ryan
She always eats my lunch.,6,1,Erin
Wahhh...,7,11,Andy
The Dundies!De,7,20,Michael
"Okay, put it on my card.",6,15,Michael
I think you need to confess...,1,3,Dwight
Okay I give up. What are you?,9,5,Pam
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.,4,1,Michael
"Pam, you're trustworthy-",2,8,Michael

Hello.,5,16,Michael
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.,6,18,Jim
Hey. We're back.,7,23,Andy
Nevermind.,4,9,Jim
"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, ""What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him."" And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",6,22,Dwight
"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.",7,1,Andy

How long is it?,7,3,Michael
"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.",2,5,Michael

It's not that funny.,8,6,Oscar
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. This is Pam. I did?",3,12,Pam
Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!,3,23,Dwight

"Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.",7,4,Michael

Kelly is disqualified!,6,21,Dwight
"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, ""Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.""",2,20,Michael
That's a good one.,7,12,Andy

"Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. But no one can become me.",1,4,Dwight
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now.,2,8,Michael
I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.,6,14,Michael
"That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.",2,1,Michael
"Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I’m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.",9,12,Erin

I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.,8,20,Jim
"Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, ""Brbrbrbrbr!"" also?",3,23,Michael
It was indescribable.,5,20,Ryan
"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.",2,12,Jim
Congratulations!,7,20,Michael
It's not.,5,20,Pam
"No, sit down. ""Seasonal."" Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide.",8,15,Dwight
"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?",3,21,Jim
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.,8,24,Pam
You want me to invite Matt?,6,19,Darryl

"Wow, that’s—",9,21,Jim
"Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?",5,19,Michael
Hurl your feces.,7,15,Dwight
"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F.

"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.",6,22,Andy
I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,9,14,Dwight
No he did not. I don't need his permission.,2,13,Michael
"Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?",9,4,Jim
"I don’t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.",9,12,Pam

"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",6,3,Michael
"I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it.

"No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",2,12,Michael
"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",2,21,Michael
"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.",1,2,Jim
I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.,3,14,Michael
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?,6,20,Erin

"Last year, I went to a seminar called ""The Ten Secrets of Real Estate"". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.",7,13,Andy
Mistake.,2,15,Phyllis

That's what she said.,7,8,Michael
I have been my whole life.,6,2,Dwight
"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father. But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  ""Hi, everyone! Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor. First, the great news - I am expecting. The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL). Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met. Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father. Best, Jan. P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.""",5,1,Jim
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.,5,20,Michael
Apology rejected.,5,17,Dwight
Uh...,4,8,Michael
"Cute kids, thanks for coming.",8,24,Dwight
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,2,21,Pam
"Hey, how'd we do?",7,18,Michael
"Yeah, I feel terrible about it.",2,13,Oscar
I was never given a name.,5,18,Michael
"Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?",7,24,Kevin

"Don't, don't.",3,22,Michael
"I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. Whizzzzz. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!",3,13,Andy
"Spot, spot, spot, spot ...",3,8,Dwight
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?,2,13,Michael
"Eh, it's not worth it.",5,4,Dwight
Kevin. You heard anything yet?,2,19,Michael
"Yeah, which one?",7,14,Andy
"That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.",7,5,Pam
"Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.",9,10,Angela
"Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",6,23,Jim
"Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-",8,24,Oscar
We have better service than they do!,2,18,Dwight
"Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?",8,5,Erin
"Okay, I think we're good.",2,8,Michael
"She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...Dwight &",7,10,Dwight
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.,3,23,Pam
"Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.",8,15,Dwight
"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.",8,18,Pam
She got pregnant before the wedding.,8,13,Oscar
You know what this is?,2,8,Dwight
I feel like its--,6,8,Pam
This constitutes identity fraud.,6,5,Oscar
I do not wanna talk about this.,3,4,Angela
Alright. Hi. Any messages?,6,7,Michael
Theater.,8,16,Jim
"Best ad ever. Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?",4,5,Andy
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?,7,13,Dwight
"Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.",3,15,Pam
"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.",2,5,Jim
"We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.",4,6,Michael
"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.",4,1,Pam
"They hate me, Pam.",8,13,Jim
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,1,1,Jim
Well-,4,8,Michael
"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.",2,16,Angela
"Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.",1,3,Dwight
Da na na na na.,5,5,Michael
Five minutes apart.,6,16,Pam
"The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that’s good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it’s really more like they’re just people who work in an office and I’m their manager. Yeah that’s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.",8,8,Andy
"Put it on, man.",8,5,Darryl
He'll die.,7,4,Dwight
Kevin Malone.,3,8,Kevin
"Oh, like a goodbye trip.",8,12,Erin
"No, this is my time! You don’t belt on my time! I belt on my time.",9,22,Andy
My name is Kevin.,9,4,Kevin
Is that all it was?,9,23,Kevin
"Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.",5,18,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no, we don’t need to call the police. They’ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone’s business, right, Pam?",8,17,Andy
"Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.",9,9,Angela
Okay. Um... Got you something.,3,18,Jim
"Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.",3,22,Jim
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?,3,10,Angela
We did it! We did it!,3,7,Dwight
"It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.",5,22,Jim

$645.,5,9,Michael
"Alright, let me explain. Again. Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... ... I have to go make a call.",2,19,Michael
"Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.",2,21,Michael
"No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!",5,3,Dwight
"You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...",2,14,Michael
"Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...",6,2,Dwight
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.,9,21,Jim
"No, I gotta go. Text me later.",6,23,Michael
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.,7,8,Pam
"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",7,11,Michael
"Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.",7,9,Dwight
"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",2,3,Michael
Stay calm!,5,13,Michael
"Ok, everybody ready?",9,22,Erin
"Now is really not the time, Meredith.",5,2,Michael
"I know, but you wanted the big thing.",6,19,Ryan
"Oh, Pam with the dirty talk.",2,13,Michael
"You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.",6,23,Ryan
I totally see that.,4,8,Oscar
"Yes, it is. Carry on.",9,21,Dwight
EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.,7,24,Andy
Hidden from them.,3,8,Kevin
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,2,20,Dwight
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,6,10,Michael
Irrelevant.,5,17,Michael
"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.",2,2,Michael
"$30,000? There's gotta be another way.",6,23,Dwight
"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...",3,23,Michael
"Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.",8,21,Angela
"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...",4,12,Michael
"Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.",9,14,Oscar
Why? Is it employee’s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.,9,3,Andy
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.,3,10,Dwight
Not classy.,5,18,Pam
Hot tamales.,5,11,Kevin
I really want to do this!,9,23,Pam
"Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  Michael Scott here.",6,2,Michael
"Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.",8,20,Ryan
"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",7,7,Pam
Hello.,7,11,Michael
Well it’s not that easy. It’s kind of sometimes difficult.,8,9,Jim
That's bad.,6,5,Dwight
Thank... Yeah...,1,2,Oscar
"Right! Hey, what's up? Everything ok?",9,10,Jim
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,2,13,Pam
"Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!",6,6,Pam
"Let’s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?",9,19,Dwight
You wouldn't tell your mom?,5,6,Jim
Mm. I like your shoes.,5,5,Phyllis
"What's up, Pam?",2,12,Oscar
You feel good?,3,8,Jim
They don't hate you.,8,13,Pam
How’s Florida?,9,23,Erin
Get me Armani.,4,4,Michael
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.,6,19,Pam
Maybe. Thanks.,2,17,Jim
"Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.",2,16,Oscar
"Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like ""Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,"" or, ""What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?"" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, ""Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted."" ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.",6,16,Andy
"You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!",8,22,Dwight
"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.",6,16,Jim
"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",7,1,Pam

"Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.",9,17,Jim
Bearded man boy.,4,2,Kevin
Phyllis.Delivery man Would you sign here?,2,16,Pam
I’m sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called “pecker Poker”.  It’s the game of cards that gets you hard.,8,5,Erin
"Not my favorite, but...",4,14,Jim
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!,2,19,Michael
"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.",2,10,Michael
Is it going to be worth it?,7,10,Michael
"Get whatever you want, on me.",7,1,Pam
Great work Dwight.,5,23,Jim

People!,2,4,Dwight
I'll check them all.,2,8,Ryan
"Hi Katy, nice to meet you.",1,6,Jim
"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.",2,19,Dwight
"You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.",4,4,Dwight
I could have helped.,5,3,Michael
"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",8,20,Pam
"Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they’re not even good. Really, they’re bad. Like you and your son.",9,11,Dwight
"No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.",8,24,Erin
What have we got here?,4,3,Jim
Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.,3,9,Pam
Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.,5,8,Dwight
"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.",3,11,Michael
Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.,9,15,Kevin
"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.",8,21,Andy
"Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.",4,11,Michael
"One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?",2,21,Michael
"I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...",2,22,Jim
"Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?",8,4,Kevin
I got a splinter.,2,10,Dwight
"Michael, what's going on?",3,7,Pam
...That was weird.,6,15,Andy
"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",1,4,Dwight
That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.,3,4,Phyllis
"Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.",3,13,Pam
"Well, there is a ball.",3,4,Phyllis
That's nice though.,4,4,Michael
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.,3,8,Dwight
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.,9,4,Dwight
Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother-,5,9,Michael
Sounds like a plan.,9,2,Dwight
I'll do the best I can.,5,24,Dwight
"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",7,11,Michael
Can you come here please?,6,4,Pam
"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",2,12,Michael

Been thinking about you.,2,8,Michael
"OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.",1,5,Michael
You're not on anything?,2,20,Dwight
"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?",6,11,Michael
"Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.",3,12,Andy
"Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. Yes!",3,22,Jim

"Son, you have to talk louder.",5,6,Jim
I just-- what?,6,3,Jim
"If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude.",3,19,Kevin
"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.",6,23,Andy
"Nnnnn, that's not... okay.",6,2,Dwight
And do my job?,2,12,Pam
I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.,1,5,Dwight

O..ok. Um..good.,3,8,Jim
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.,6,4,Andy
How'd that get there?,5,11,Dwight

Not relevant.,4,1,Pam
"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",8,9,Dwight
Conflict!,2,7,Michael
"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",4,4,Michael
"Oh my God, did you see ""The Apprentice"" last night?",2,8,Pam
It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.,5,7,Dwight
"Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results.",7,24,Phyllis
Next suggestion.,2,8,Dwight
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?,4,3,Michael
"Yeah, that'd be nice.",3,16,Pam

She never sent it to you?,5,15,Pam
"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.",8,11,Dwight
"Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.",6,14,Michael
"Well, then he's not a senator.",7,11,Michael
All-in.,2,22,Kevin
Never cry wolf.,8,8,Andy
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?,5,17,Kevin
"Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.",8,19,Phyllis
"Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.",9,14,Pam
How do you return coffee?,6,5,Erin
Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.,5,1,Ryan
What you want a cookie?,1,2,Michael
Hmm.,4,7,Pam
"In terms of land, not population.",7,10,Michael
"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",6,3,Jim
"The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming ""Opa!"" Which means ""congratulations,"" so...",5,6,Michael
Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.,9,15,Pam
"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.",1,4,Michael
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice. Okay? I'm not kidding!",4,8,Pam
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,6,6,Michael
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.,5,26,Michael
At these prices with this service...,5,24,Ryan

Okay. I'll see you in a bit. She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.,1,6,Michael
"I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...",3,1,Michael
"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.",7,5,Michael
"Ok, just get to the good part.",5,25,Pam
"No, no, you won't do that. Nope.",4,6,Jim
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.,5,25,Michael
"I don’t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.",9,21,Pam
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.,3,6,Kevin
Thanks.,5,15,Jim
I don’t know. He wasn’t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn’t hire his wife.,8,9,Jim
"You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.",4,13,Jim
He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?,8,2,Jim
"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.",6,18,Michael
"Yeah, yeah. Totally.",7,10,Jim
Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up.,3,21,Angela
"Jim, what do you say?",5,20,Dwight
Baquette.,4,1,Jim
"Hey, it's not a surprise.",5,15,Dwight
"Oh, my God. Please.",6,4,Jim
I don't.,6,6,Michael
"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",3,8,Andy
"Uh, hmmm.",2,20,Pam
"That’s—that’s awful, Angela. I’m so sorry.",9,21,Oscar
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,6,3,Jim
Everybody!,2,4,Dwight
"Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?",4,3,Jim
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...,1,6,Dwight
"Per-diem. Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.",3,2,Michael
Uhhh. Can't.,4,3,Jim
"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.",2,2,Michael
Casey Dean!,9,22,Andy
"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...",4,2,Michael
"Mmum, still wrong.",8,1,Jim
"Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah.",6,9,Michael
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.,7,13,Andy
"Oops, that’s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?",8,17,Jim
"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",6,7,Jim
That's pretty funny.,2,18,Jim
"Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.",4,9,Jim
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?,3,13,Angela
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.,9,20,Andy
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!,6,3,Angela
Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.,5,25,Erin
"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",6,5,Dwight
"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.",7,12,Pam
Let's go mini-golfing.,5,1,Michael
Hey what's up? You called?,8,14,Darryl
"Devon, wait, please.",2,5,Michael
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?,7,17,Andy
"Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?",5,13,Dwight
All right. We are infinitely sorry.,3,20,Michael
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.,6,1,Jim
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?,7,7,Andy
"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",9,13,Pam
Yeah. Wow. I just miss you so much.,7,14,Michael
"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...",4,12,Michael
"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.",9,10,Dwight
But that doesn't sound good.,2,5,Pam
This is Dunder Mifflin...,2,1,Dwight
Normal. Ugly.,7,5,Dwight
"Alright, yeah fine so whatever...",6,2,Darryl
Yes! The dude is an enigma.,8,9,Andy
Like an AIDS test?,2,1,Dwight
"Yup, I guess so.",2,7,Jim
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.,7,24,Jim
"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.",3,11,Michael
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.,6,8,Jim
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.,7,23,Dwight
"I want my baby back, baby back, baby back Michael and",2,7,Michael
"Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right.",3,20,Jim
"Well, don't look, freak!",7,1,Dwight
Dragging sticks.,8,16,Jim
"Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.",3,13,Ryan
"Oh. Oh, no.  It's Jan. What do I do?",3,21,Michael
"You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.",2,19,Angela
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.,1,4,Oscar
"What for? We haven’t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren’t deep fried, right?",9,23,Dwight
Sorry. Man.,3,8,Jim
"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?",2,7,Ryan
I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.,7,1,Michael
I'm Erin Hannon.,9,2,Erin
"Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.",6,19,Darryl
It's pretty good actually.,9,4,Jim
You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.,3,20,Pam
You can... You can do it Ryan.,8,17,Jim
"Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.",1,6,Michael
Yeah.,5,4,Michael
You're better. You're better than my best.,5,5,Michael
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?,6,22,Darryl
"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper…,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I’ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. And go ahead!",9,23,Pam
You know it.,6,4,Dwight
That's hilarious.,6,23,Kevin
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,8,18,Pam
Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,6,7,Dwight
Oh right.,3,10,Pam
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.,7,3,Angela
What are you talking about Michael?,6,3,Angela
What was the case?,8,13,Erin
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.,7,3,Dwight
What's that?,6,21,Jim
"Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.",2,4,Dwight
"Shake it, shake it!",7,5,Michael
"Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...",6,6,Dwight
I know that's what he said.,2,5,Dwight
"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.",9,2,Dwight
So who is the godfather?,7,7,Michael
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.,9,21,Andy
Step away.,6,1,Pam
Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.,7,3,Angela
"I hope you’ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it’s time for another episode of “Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire”.",9,11,Dwight
There is no way that hurt.,2,18,Dwight
"When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he’s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he’s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.",9,22,Pam
Thank you. That feels good.,7,3,Andy
That's great.,6,10,Pam
You're a hoarder. My god!,8,10,Andy
"Night, Oscar.",9,21,Kevin
Mmmmm.,4,3,Darryl
Wet Tuna!,5,1,Andy
"Michael, have you met the Penguin?",3,8,Kevin
I think it’s good. He likes fishing.,9,8,Pam
"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",9,13,Jim
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.,4,1,Kevin
"So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.",8,9,Andy
BlackBerry. Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit? You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  Excuse me while I type on my Banana. I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  Apple.,4,2,Michael
This party’s tight. The fog is cool.,8,5,Darryl
Deceit does not come easy to me.,5,24,Dwight
"Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he’s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.",9,23,Dwight
Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.,2,14,Michael
Hey.,7,8,Jim
"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.",8,11,Andy
"I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.",6,19,Michael
"Don’t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.",9,21,Jim
"That's honest. Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",4,2,Jim
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,3,8,Pam
I'M TRYING! GOD!,7,4,Michael
"Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?",8,5,Dwight
Sometimes.,5,19,Kevin
"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",4,1,Jim
I didn't know you were going to be here.,8,4,Andy
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.,6,10,Michael
"Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.",6,23,Jim
"It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.",3,3,Angela
Better a cappella.,5,21,Andy
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.,6,17,Erin
Seriously?,7,17,Andy
Come on Michael. You can...,7,10,Oscar
I'm missing my scarf. Oh.,7,15,Pam
What are you? A monk?,2,5,Phyllis
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.,7,15,Oscar
"No, right, no, no.",2,9,Pam
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.,9,1,Andy
"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.",8,14,Jim
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?,3,10,Michael
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.,6,10,Dwight
You don't know them all?,7,7,Angela
Nice.,8,19,Kevin
"one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.",2,3,Dwight
Spoken like a true root man.,9,1,Dwight
Mmhmm.,7,11,Michael
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.,7,15,Jim
"Oh, no, my God.",5,4,Michael
"First rule in road-side beet sales Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, ""Wow, I need this beet right now."" Those are the money beets.",3,20,Dwight
"OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.",5,17,Dwight
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.,2,3,Michael
"""Yeah, right,"" what?",2,22,Pam
Understood.,7,14,Pam
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,6,6,Michael
"I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...",7,4,Dwight
"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",4,12,Michael
"Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.",5,14,Michael
What? What's so wierd?,3,16,Dwight
"Let me show you what I mean. Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",6,10,Jim
Yeah.,3,2,Michael
"Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.",8,14,Jim
God. How do whalers do it?,8,1,Dwight
"We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!",2,4,Dwight
"I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...",5,8,Ryan
Shhh.,3,4,Michael
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.,3,19,Kevin
"But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.",3,13,Michael
"Are we rotating seats, or?",6,17,Andy
She's wearing a onesie,6,18,Jim
"Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.",3,22,Michael
It is warm feelings.,6,12,Dwight
100%.,1,3,Dwight
I'm in.,6,17,Oscar
"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",2,3,Michael
Salad.,3,17,Dwight
"So, that's how it's gonna be.",2,14,Jim
Bye.,2,16,Pam
"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",8,12,Jim
"OK. How do you feel about Maine? I'm on it. I'll see you later, love.",5,1,Andy
"He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.",2,21,Dwight
"Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.",3,22,Michael
So what comes next?,9,9,Erin
Ohhh... mmm...,6,22,Michael
"Mmhmm. I had something very personal I would like to discuss.  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",4,7,Michael
"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.",5,2,Michael
"Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?",7,2,Dwight
"Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",8,10,Jim
"I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - ""Boo!"" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - ""Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high."" Scared the s**t out of me.",8,5,Andy
"Bottle of rum it is. Alright, shall we?",6,6,Pam
"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",6,4,Dwight
Whoa-oh-oh-oh.,3,8,Andy
We livin’ like rock stars. I’m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.,9,22,Darryl
"It’s pretty great, right? I mean, we’re coming along… Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis’s timeline",9,11,Jim
Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-,5,4,Michael
Are you warmed up?,6,23,Dwight
Good one.,6,19,Jim

Shh.,7,7,Michael
"Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.",5,6,Jim
If you let me run it.,3,3,Dwight
I'm not kidding.,7,1,Michael
Yeah.,5,2,Michael
"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",4,7,Jim
"This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?",6,16,Michael
"Well, Hol, this is it.",5,5,Kevin
As if you had a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.,3,23,Dwight
Spin move.,5,22,Dwight
"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.",3,2,Jim
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,5,17,Michael
"Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.",9,21,Dwight
When in Rome.,4,9,Michael
"Baby, if you’re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.",8,18,Darryl
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?,8,14,Pam
"Alright. Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...",2,5,Jim
"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",2,3,Jim
"Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.",3,19,Darryl
It's hot in there. How's the naan?,3,6,Pam
"Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.",3,13,Andy
"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.",2,12,Pam
"I'm young, and I can … and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.",8,16,Erin
Hey. What are we doing?  What's the game? I want in.,3,4,Andy
Hello sir.,7,16,Michael

You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.,8,18,Dwight
Sure.,2,18,Pam
I am not going to tell you anything.,6,24,Michael
Who is this guy again?,2,19,Oscar
I missed you too.,5,7,Pam
So weird.,3,13,Jim
"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.",2,15,Michael
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?,3,7,Dwight
"Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...",5,1,Pam
"When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.",4,1,Angela
Really shove it.,2,10,Dwight

Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,3,23,Michael

"Yeah, Freecell.",1,2,Pam
I thought it went great.,9,7,Dwight
"Gotcha something. And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",8,6,Andy
There you go! Where's the other?,5,18,Michael
It’s too loud.,9,22,Angela
Why not?,7,22,Jim
Our fake winnings,8,3,Jim
Feels good.,6,6,Michael
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.,7,18,Kevin
"That's called card stock. That's what you're feeling. Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, ""Am I good enough for this job? Do I have what it takes?"" And I think we both know the answer. We'll find that out together. You can keep that.",4,13,Michael
"Yes, indeed.",3,23,Michael
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.,7,21,Angela
"Yeah. Yeah, it’s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are…for real.",9,23,Darryl
God!,9,8,Angela
"In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I’m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there’s a mini-reunion. A kind of a “where are they now” panel at a local theatre. It’ll be nice to see everyone again. I haven’t seen Kevin since we let him go.",9,23,Dwight
"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",2,12,Michael
"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?A.J. It's pretty serious, yes.",5,15,Michael
I don't know.,2,14,Pam
Okay. Come on! Jim!,6,17,Dwight
You're welcome.,2,10,Michael
"Hey, I’m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim’s away. I’m in a position where I’m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",9,13,Pam
"Oh, actually she can.",9,7,Pam
Are we going?  Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.,1,2,Michael
I can't. I-,9,16,Erin
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.,6,2,Darryl
That was a really cool move.,9,22,Kevin
He does not like that wall.,8,21,Darryl
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,6,3,Dwight
Here.,2,3,Pam
"Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.",2,3,Jim
Plus everyone would know who you meant.,8,20,Oscar
"Calm, please",5,13,Dwight
"I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.",3,13,Dwight
"So, kinda like a receptionist.",9,16,Pam
Yes.,2,19,Michael
"Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!",8,4,Andy
"Bring it in. Morning cheer. Michael, Pam &",5,22,Michael
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.,2,8,Jim
"Well, you'll figure it out.",6,10,Pam
Fair enough.,2,3,Jim
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.,3,16,Michael
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...,4,12,Dwight
"I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.",8,9,Darryl
"Well, you seem to have this under control.",2,1,Jim
I’m delivering it from the fridge. It’s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?,8,7,Andy
Nice.,7,23,Kevin
Just say the word.,5,21,Michael
"I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.",8,5,Erin
"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.",2,12,Pam
Good. Great.,2,19,Michael
"I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.",8,14,Angela
"Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They’re family-owned, but don’t let that take away from your edge!",9,8,Erin
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,1,3,Jim
"Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.",3,5,Ryan
"Well, get it out of here.",3,10,Pam
It's nothing.,4,1,Angela
"But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.",4,11,Ryan
"Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.",1,4,Dwight
I didn't see that movie.,6,20,Andy
"Well, I mean he humped Michael.",7,17,Jim
Who makes it?,3,18,Kevin
Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?,4,4,Michael
"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",5,23,Michael
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.,8,6,Darryl
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.,3,22,Michael
"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.",4,11,Michael
What?!,2,21,Michael
"No, I'm not.",2,9,Angela
Bye.,9,20,Pam
"Stop flustering me, everybody!",5,24,Ryan
God... Damn it! Why us?,1,4,Dwight
"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",2,2,Michael
I am dead inside.,7,11,Michael
Same thing.,2,3,Dwight
"Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.",3,16,Dwight
"Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",6,9,Andy
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call...,7,19,Andy
"No, it's ah...",1,4,Angela
"Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",6,11,Jim
"Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now. And the future... is me.",3,23,Michael
I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.,6,20,Erin
"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.",8,8,Andy
"Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.",2,22,Dwight

"Michael, you need to get out of this.",3,21,Pam
we good?Off-camera Yeah,9,1,Jim
"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.",6,10,Michael
"Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.",6,16,Dwight
Believe it.,4,6,Dwight
"Oh, yeah. Yes!",4,2,Dwight

C’mon.,8,1,Dwight

"...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.",9,6,Dwight
These wings are all fat and bone.,3,17,Oscar
"OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",3,1,Michael
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.,8,4,Oscar
Don't... I...,7,10,Michael
Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.,6,24,Michael
Tuna. Check you later.,4,2,Kevin

"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",8,10,Andy
"Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.",4,4,Pam
Does anything go on top of the mouse?,9,19,Andy
"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.",8,20,Ryan
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?,6,13,Michael
"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.",7,3,Michael
"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?",2,3,Ryan
"Two forms of ID, please.",6,16,Dwight
"Aw, that's so sweet!",8,18,Pam
Excuse me. Tall Girl #1 Yeah?,4,11,Dwight
Like Frodo!,6,15,Ryan
I'm sorry. Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.,6,4,Michael
"By 200, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",9,22,Jim
"Michael, I hated the twirl.",6,10,Kevin
"Good luck, Michael.",6,10,Dwight
Who is this guy? We are killing it.,9,14,Jim
"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?",1,4,Pam
We're going skating.,7,12,Darryl
"Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing?",1,4,Jim
"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",6,6,Jim
"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",4,1,Michael
Now. Get good work done. Concentrate.,4,8,Pam
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.,7,11,Dwight
I think I know the problem.,6,10,Jim
"A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...",2,1,Michael
"If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.",9,6,Darryl
"Everyone's like, ""Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?"" Or, Uh, ""Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!""",7,9,Ryan
"Ok, let's take 15, again.",3,18,Michael
"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for",2,16,Jim

Smells good.,4,11,Michael
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.,5,7,Oscar
He said he wanted me there for support.,9,14,Oscar

"Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. Desert Island. Five movies. Go.",2,4,Jim
No way. What if I meet someone?,6,4,Dwight
"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",6,9,Jim
You ready?,8,24,Pam
"I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.",7,9,Michael
"Well, what does that... is that... okay.",8,7,Pam
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.,2,1,Michael
I didn't sign anything.,1,5,Jim
Okay.,6,24,Michael
But you didn't want to start with us?,5,19,Kevin
It is. Thanks again.,5,4,Pam
"Thanks, so sweet.",3,12,Kevin
Angela’s special repairman is here.,9,23,Phyllis
Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.,2,9,Pam
I love you-love you.,7,15,Michael
"For Kelly, that seems a bit much.",3,6,Michael
Hey.,4,12,Jim
"An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?",9,22,Jim
"Guys, guys, guys, please. Ok, all right, it's all yours now.",6,19,Ryan
"I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...",9,5,Dwight
"Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That’s what I call the sun now.",9,7,Andy
"Dwight, come o-",8,18,Jim
"You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It’s not much. But if you see it in the right way…And that’s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn’t once show me doing my origami.",9,23,Oscar
"Guys! Over here, we found the bus.",8,8,Oscar
Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.,2,5,Michael
"Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.",2,16,Michael
Bye now.,6,14,Michael
"Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? Yep.Student 2 Just following up on that first question...",3,16,Michael

"Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...",9,14,Kevin
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian,9,3,Dwight
"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go.",7,11,Dwight
I’m trying to make him feel important.,8,17,Dwight
"If he comes out, distract him.",8,1,Pam
"Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...",6,16,Michael
"I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.",7,11,Pam
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.,9,9,Angela
As would I.,9,4,Kevin
"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.",9,16,Pam
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.,8,4,Ryan
"No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.",4,14,Kevin
What the hell is that?,4,14,Michael
"Okay. Okay. ""Achey Breaky Fart.""",5,20,Michael
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?,9,3,Kevin
Hey Dwight.,5,1,Jim
Make it higher? Okay.,6,22,Andy
"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.",4,9,Michael
"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.",8,13,Jim
"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.",7,23,Dwight
"No, you can't fire me.",1,3,Jim
"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",1,5,Michael
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.,6,1,Dwight
I surrender.,7,11,Jim
"Hmmm, dare I?  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.",5,8,Michael
"Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.",9,23,Darryl
I gotta go do this.,7,20,Jim
"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",6,9,Jim
It's not Brian's fault.,9,15,Pam
Yeah that's great. Great.,6,17,Jim
"That feels good, Dwight.",5,25,Phyllis
"I need somebody to pick a card. One of the new people, please? Tony?",3,8,Michael
"Michael, I have so much to learn from you.",2,6,Dwight
Disruptive.,6,3,Michael
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.,4,12,Michael
"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",6,15,Michael
Do you need a hand?,8,6,Erin
"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.",1,1,Dwight
I need you to get rid of the tree.,5,10,Phyllis
I'll try and think of one. When...,2,17,Dwight

Okay.,6,5,Michael
"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.",7,24,Andy
I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?,8,4,Angela
Anything goes.,7,15,Michael
"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",6,3,Jim
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.,5,14,Pam
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.,9,6,Andy
"I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!",9,3,Dwight
Mmm.,4,3,Michael
We were just kids. What did we know?,6,16,Jim
"Hey New York, Happy Halloween!",5,5,Jim
"Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.",3,16,Pam
"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",1,3,Dwight
"Michael, I was doing so well.",6,9,Phyllis
Oh!,3,19,Jim

"Cece’s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I’ve been working with her on her move. It’s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It’s kind of like this. It’s pretty cute, right?",9,12,Jim
"Right.DJ So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.",7,12,Darryl
"No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!",7,14,Ryan
Pass.,7,10,Michael
She will have a greekaccino.,7,13,Michael

"You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.",3,15,Jim

In front of me.,7,6,Michael
"Oh, thanks, Oscar. You’re such an angel.",9,8,Angela
No! How? I'm so clean!,9,10,Pam
By the end of the day? That's impossible.,3,11,Angela
Stanley got to go.,6,22,Pam
"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",6,23,Michael
Really? Michael went in with him?,2,12,Pam
“Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.”,9,18,Jim

"He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",2,5,Michael

Poor little fella.,3,4,Dwight
Not my urine.,2,20,Dwight
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.,5,6,Angela
Yeah. I withdrew too.,4,3,Michael
What do you think of Angela? There's just something about her. All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.,4,3,Andy
"Well, I’m the one offering the job.",9,13,Dwight
Go go go go go go!,7,20,Michael
"No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?",5,21,Jim

Totally.,8,9,Andy
"Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.",6,4,Oscar
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.,4,6,Michael
I didn’t realize we were this close.,9,22,Darryl
"Wow, was it the age difference?",5,1,Pam
Are you socialist?,5,12,Dwight

If you want to sit on this-- I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer.,6,4,Erin
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place.,8,18,Andy
What are you doing?,5,17,Jim

"Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.",2,12,Jim
Surprise!,9,23,Andy

Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.",7,18,Ryan
"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.",7,11,Michael

"Yes. I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this! What do I do? What do I do?",4,3,Michael
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. Andy don't mess with me. I'll figure something out.,6,22,Darryl
"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...",7,2,Michael
"Andy, something is wrong with that woman.",5,7,Oscar

Andy!,9,19,Erin
"I bet, for you.",5,8,Michael
"OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.",5,1,Darryl
Um... I don't think so.,2,2,Jim
"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.",7,17,Pam

"Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 500 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.",5,26,Jim

"Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right?",8,13,Jim

Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.,3,8,Dwight
"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",2,5,Pam
"What's that, pipsqueak?",4,3,Michael

"Hey, look who’s back, Dwight Junior.",9,11,Oscar
Your mom?,8,14,Darryl
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,7,7,Pam
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,6,4,Pam
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?,5,21,Michael
Wow... that is insane!,7,19,Michael
"OK. Stanley, come on.",5,1,Oscar
"No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.",4,6,Jim
"Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.",9,2,Pam

I have a laundry machine!,3,3,Michael
"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.",5,15,Dwight
A dog-like obedience to authority,2,5,Pam
"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",7,18,Michael
"Yeah, you know me.",2,1,Dwight
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.,3,22,Michael
"That's a hobby, unless it's for food.",8,16,Dwight
You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.,3,15,Michael
"Confidence, Dwight.",2,17,Michael
Pushing on.,2,8,Dwight

"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?",5,17,Michael
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!,6,12,Kevin
"Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.",9,17,Erin
"Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.",5,3,Michael
Michael. Stop.,6,4,Pam

You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?,7,2,Michael
It's kind of an impoverished country.,3,11,Pam
"Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said ""awesome"" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.",3,19,Kevin
"I had um, one of those danishes.",4,3,Michael
Okay...,2,21,Michael

If you sit in the back.,3,6,Pam
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.,8,22,Oscar
"Absolutely, I do.",9,13,Dwight
"They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.",7,10,Dwight
What's jazz hands?,7,23,Dwight
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,2,15,Pam

"No, no. No.",6,21,Michael
"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.",6,16,Jim
"Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",4,2,Michael
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.,5,1,Angela
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.,7,6,Kevin
"Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?",7,12,Phyllis
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is. Mr.,9,18,Dwight
Out of loyalty to this company...,2,5,Dwight
Do you want to play-,2,7,Jim
"Oh my God, David. That's horrible.",6,12,Jim
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.,7,10,Oscar
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.,3,16,Dwight
"Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.",9,8,Angela
"Oh, did not!",2,8,Michael
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.,7,3,Dwight
On more week.,5,7,Phyllis
"Yeah, I can see that.",7,5,Angela
"Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.",2,11,Michael
Different stuff.,4,3,Kevin
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.,6,5,Michael
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.,2,6,Pam
"Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!",9,23,Kevin
It's over.,5,11,Andy
"Oh, okay. Okay, I will.",8,20,Pam
Come on. Let's get back to this.,2,8,Dwight
"No, she's lying.",7,12,Ryan
Who will be watching the children?,7,2,Jim
That’s right. Will you just give us a second?,8,17,Dwight
"Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.",7,2,Jim
"Well, now suddenly he can see. Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. There you go steaming hot cup of joe.",1,6,Michael
Colder.,9,22,Erin
Yeah-es.,2,15,Michael
"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",7,17,Michael
Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!,3,19,Dwight
You have two seconds.,5,22,Michael
"Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?",8,21,Ryan
"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. Hey! You look great! Let's go!",5,20,Pam
"Dunder Mifflin.Andy, Creed, Kevin,",4,5,Darryl
"Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?",6,9,Kevin
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.,5,5,Darryl
What I mean to say is we don't want to.,8,20,Oscar
"It's not really food, right?",8,13,Jim
"Every time there's a silence, your brain's like ""Heh-heh-huh-huh"" .",7,22,Jim
Decent people everywhere will get offended.,6,4,Angela
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?,5,11,Dwight
"Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!",8,16,Kevin
Mega-Desk.,6,17,Dwight
"Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.",3,18,Angela
"OK, Hey, man, how's it going?",3,11,Michael
We gotta get someone else in there right now.,7,5,Jim
I checked it more than once.,9,9,Dwight
You mean Toastmasters?,2,17,Pam
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.,9,23,Dwight
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.,8,4,Oscar
"Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.",7,12,Andy
"I know. You’re gonna be okay, Monkey.",9,8,Dwight
Are you going to beat me up?,3,19,Kevin
That was an intelligent comment.,6,4,Dwight
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,3,23,Dwight
"Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",3,15,Michael
And that blue busty gal? What's her story?,3,6,Angela
Right. Okay? Great.,7,13,Dwight
When? When did he tell you? Today?,6,12,Dwight
Word.,2,15,Dwight
"You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...",3,19,Darryl
"Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.",2,20,Michael
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?,3,12,Jim
Great.,7,24,Pam
"Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.",8,21,Ryan
A costume?,8,17,Jim
"Michael, he made huge cuts.",1,3,Pam
"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.",2,16,Michael
Pass.,7,10,Michael
Nope. Nope. Not yet.,5,6,Michael
"This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?",5,12,Dwight
Seems like it's leaning one way.,6,10,Ryan
"Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?",5,19,Michael
I am fine.,2,1,Pam
"Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",4,6,Michael
"I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute.",8,12,Erin
Mm-hmm.,7,13,Pam
Oh... no... really?,6,8,Dwight
I shall come by at your convenience.,9,9,Darryl
"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.",3,10,Michael
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!,9,8,Oscar
Well...,2,7,Michael
"Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.",5,6,Ryan
"No, I...",2,22,Jim
Oh come on.,2,12,Michael
"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",4,2,Michael
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? Took me two weeks.,8,11,Andy
"I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.",5,7,Michael
Actually Ryan.,8,9,Ryan
Cake.,5,1,Phyllis
"Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...",9,2,Oscar
Do you mean vibrate?,2,15,Jim
"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.",3,23,Michael
But not to us.,9,7,Pam
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.,5,23,Andy
"That's right, let's do this.",6,16,Michael
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.,6,19,Oscar
Nope.,8,24,Jim
Well... there's no instructions.,7,18,Andy
State your business!,4,4,Dwight
"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",2,6,Michael
I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it.,5,23,Andy
"Shoot, shoot it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.",1,5,Michael
Did you just say you remember him?,7,2,Jim
"Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.",3,10,Michael
"Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it.",3,14,Dwight
Mmm-hmm. I know.,6,8,Michael
Has this been on the entire time?,5,15,Angela
"Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don’t.  And I don’t.  But I am so excited to be a part of it.",8,1,Erin
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,8,7,Pam
"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.",5,18,Pam
"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",2,5,Michael
"I do, yeah. Big plans.",2,9,Michael
At what time?,5,22,Dwight
"Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?",3,18,Dwight
Nice. Do you have any blonde women?,3,14,Dwight
"Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.",2,4,Pam
"I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...",9,17,Oscar
Well fought. I accept the outcome.,8,19,Dwight
"Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.",5,5,Darryl
"Well, yeah.",2,14,Michael
"Ok yes, I would never do that.",2,9,Michael
Here we go. This is gonna be good.,5,10,Michael
"We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?",6,24,Michael
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.,5,9,Dwight
"I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.",9,4,Dwight
You know how I feel about IHOP.,5,12,Dwight
"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",1,1,Michael
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.,4,8,Michael
Next!,9,10,Erin
"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",8,8,Pam
"Oh, no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea.",9,12,Erin
"In your schedule it just says nine til noon is ""creative space"" and I thought this could be part of that.",6,5,Erin
"Yes, this is the one.",2,2,Darryl
Oh Pam.,5,17,Dwight
"No, not yet.",2,19,Kevin
It's going to be alright.,6,16,Jim
"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",4,1,Michael
"No, not yet, Michael.",6,16,Pam
"The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!",6,16,Oscar
"Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.",5,22,Michael
Ok. Remember Spider face?,5,13,Jim
"Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",3,7,Michael
"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",2,12,Michael
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,3,8,Andy
Just about... yup. Now.,3,9,Jim
What? Ooh!,9,23,Dwight
Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.,2,7,Michael
Mmwa. Mmwa.,4,3,Michael
Wow! What happened in there?,2,14,Michael
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.,9,10,Kevin
"Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.",7,8,Dwight
Nice.,7,18,Kevin
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.,6,4,Andy
Gravel company?,9,2,Jim
"Uh, hey... Creed?",2,5,Michael
"No, that wasn't fun.",4,6,Jim
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,2,20,Dwight
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.,2,3,Oscar
That was a triple.,9,4,Darryl
Mmhmm.,5,9,Michael
"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.",3,2,Michael
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.,6,7,Pam
I heard you.,5,4,Angela
Roy...,1,6,Pam
I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?,2,1,Michael
"That felt really good, actually.",9,14,Darryl
Yeah.,5,12,Michael
Think that through for a sec.,9,9,Darryl
Fine. I love you.,4,8,Michael
"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.",8,8,Pam
Showtime!,7,5,Jim
I actually know a sex model.,4,10,Jim
"This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?",9,22,Dwight
"Looking good, RC!",8,22,Darryl
"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?",6,1,Michael
Beat it!,5,11,Michael
"Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.",5,4,Angela
Of the FBI.,2,7,Pam
Nice... she is so hot.,2,13,Kevin
"Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too.",6,7,Andy
Good game Meredith.,4,8,Jim
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,3,10,Michael
That's my office.,2,15,Darryl
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?,2,13,Kevin
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.,1,1,Michael
"Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.",2,18,Jim
"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-",9,20,Pam
"How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.",3,12,Angela
People who don't trust egg whites.,6,22,Dwight
"Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?",9,17,Dwight
You get to look at her. Why don't you hold out your hand. Tell me what you feel.,4,13,Michael
Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.,2,13,Dwight
"And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.",5,18,Pam
"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",6,21,Dwight
"I mean, it's distant, but...",9,3,Andy
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.,5,1,Angela
"Wait, why do you need three suitcases?",5,7,Dwight
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!,3,15,Angela
"I know, it's...",5,1,Michael
"Oh. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.",3,17,Pam
"Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.",9,23,Kevin
"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",3,5,Pam
"Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.",4,14,Jim
"No, it wasn’t.",9,5,Angela
Doesn't matter. Out please!,3,20,Michael
Open the gates! There’s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There’s plenty for everyone!,8,17,Dwight
"Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?",7,20,Pam
"If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.",8,21,Phyllis
"Come on, shooter!",2,22,Dwight
"You, you like that?",5,17,Michael
What do you think?,9,18,Dwight
"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?",9,10,Jim
Your two o'clock.,7,5,Erin
"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",2,22,Dwight
"Well, that's not my personality.",7,24,Erin
She’s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.,9,7,Oscar
"The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.",7,4,Dwight
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.,7,5,Dwight
"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond …",9,13,Dwight
"No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.",3,23,Michael
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.,2,4,Jim
"OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.",9,2,Darryl
"You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.",4,1,Pam
"Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.",9,6,Pam
Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.,5,19,Michael
Jim is her husband.,6,22,Michael
"Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such.",3,14,Dwight
"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.",8,7,Pam
"Very well, we will come back at 515.",5,17,Dwight
"So you know Stacy, right?",5,3,Pam
You too... Darryl.,9,14,Darryl
"Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.",6,6,Pam
Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.,2,9,Oscar
Ouchy.,3,3,Michael
Then make him pitch to you.,7,5,Dwight
"Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.",8,14,Erin
"Oh, my desk is over...",5,14,Oscar
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.,6,20,Michael
"Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They’re going to make you pay for the fish, and… they wanted to know when you can start.",9,11,Jim
"When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.",8,5,Erin
You're not gonna lose them.,7,21,Michael
Walk around apple orchards.,6,22,Andy
"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.",2,1,Jim
Ugh!,9,8,Angela
Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.,6,20,Michael
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?,9,4,Jim
"Dwight, your feedback is horrible.",5,6,Michael
"He's more, just... like... you can go.",6,19,Pam
"Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?",8,5,Andy
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.,7,5,Darryl
What does that mean?,7,10,Jim
I'm on Michael.,4,5,Ryan
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?,7,23,Oscar
"Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.",6,24,Michael
"Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...",4,1,Jim
Gay.,3,14,Michael
Ha! Tuna... Tuna Tuna Tuna.,4,2,Andy
"Are you sure? It’s really, really important.",8,7,Erin
"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.Mr.",1,2,Dwight
"No, all we need is mayonnaise.",9,10,Erin
You two are apes.,3,20,Angela
"Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?",4,2,Michael
"Gee, he was salty.",9,6,Erin
Hmm...,5,19,Pam
"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except...",8,11,Andy
One word.,1,3,Dwight
"If you would have asked me that, then you would know.",2,1,Pam
Please.,3,22,Dwight
...calendar.,1,4,Michael
"Angela, you just were—",9,21,Oscar
"They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.",7,8,Dwight
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.,8,17,Angela
"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",9,14,Pam
"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.",8,13,Andy
"Mm, that sounds great, actually.",6,17,Michael
I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.,2,15,Kevin
"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",5,15,Jim
"So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.",4,14,Michael
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!,7,2,Michael
"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",7,6,Pam
"Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It’s hopeless.",9,7,Phyllis
Some people are really popping on screen!,7,16,Andy
"Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he’s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--",9,12,Jim
"Can I get some candy, or something?",7,12,Kevin
"Yes, all right. Who else? Can I put you down for 10 pounds?",5,1,Michael
When are you talking to David Wallace?,9,13,Pam
Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?,8,6,Jim
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,4,10,Pam
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,6,11,Dwight
"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.",3,13,Michael
"Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?Mr.",5,22,Dwight
"No. We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.",4,2,Ryan
Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!,6,16,Dwight
"It's inevitable, right?",4,11,Ryan
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.,7,9,Pam
"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.",6,4,Jim
I missed you.,8,18,Jim
"Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along.  However, I rescind my apology.",5,24,Michael
Why isn't Jim wet?,6,7,Angela
"Okay, we have to get home.",6,19,Pam
"All right, good stuff.",8,11,Jim
How was your meeting with Michael?,5,6,Jim
"All right, shhh. Dwight, leave him alone.",4,11,Michael
"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice.",2,16,Michael
"Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.",5,11,Michael
I can't believe this is actually happening.,9,9,Pam
Okay!,6,5,Michael
Which one did you see?,8,4,Andy
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,7,6,Jim
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out.,1,6,Dwight
"Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?",8,4,Andy
Mm-hmm.,6,16,Pam
"Really, nothing?",5,1,Jim
"Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, ""I am so lame."" Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... You know what I'm talking about?",2,15,Michael
"Oscar, it's not that hot out.",8,3,Andy
Welcome to our land.,4,14,Dwight
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.,5,16,Michael
"It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.",5,2,Dwight
"Hey, are you okay?",8,15,Erin
What did you just thought?,7,6,Michael
You heard me!,8,20,Dwight
I found twins.,6,4,Dwight
How about 911? Anyone? 911.,5,13,Dwight
Really? We're good?,7,6,Michael
"Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",6,9,Jim
"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.",4,6,Pam
"Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?",8,18,Darryl
Yes.,2,5,Michael
Pam.,4,11,Jim
You waited for me?,3,4,Pam
Whatever you guys did earlier.,5,24,Michael
"Oh, they're forming an alliance",1,4,Dwight
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?,2,13,Pam
He wasn't volunteering today.,3,2,Dwight
Can I do some of the talking?,2,13,Dwight
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager’s job?,9,21,Dwight
Hey.,2,7,Jim
"It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.",5,18,Angela
Sure thing. 'Scuse me.,4,2,Michael
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.,3,23,Pam
Mexican isn't offensive.,1,2,Oscar
"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.",7,23,Dwight
"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?",5,16,Michael
"Well, who's that one?",6,4,Michael
Right on.,4,13,Andy
"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",1,3,Jim
"This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.",9,9,Dwight
"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.",8,3,Jim
"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",7,1,Michael
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.,8,15,Jim
No I didn’t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.,9,23,Andy
"And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home.",2,16,Michael
Sure. Sure we did.,8,12,Erin
"Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.",5,22,Michael
"That's okay, I'll do it.",6,11,Jim
"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally.",2,8,Michael
French. Classy.,5,18,Michael
4-9-1-7-4-5-1,5,17,Michael
"Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.Kelly's",3,6,Ryan
"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",2,21,Jim
"Not gravel, obviously. No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-",9,2,Jim
He's funnier than me.,7,17,Michael
"""He's up there.""",7,9,Michael
"Hey, you know what? Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself. Are you psyched about the summer?",4,13,Michael
What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,3,1,Dwight
"Congratulations, buddy.",9,21,Jim
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.,5,13,Oscar
"Ew, the exact opposite, actually.",9,22,Jim
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.,7,9,Michael
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.,5,2,Ryan
"Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?",4,13,Jim
Erin.,8,7,Andy
"We discuss... the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean.",8,20,Pam
"Yeah, some days I never go outside.",3,9,Pam
Okay. You can count on me.,6,24,Michael
"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.",5,20,Michael
Which means absolutely nothing.,2,17,Jim
Who is it?,5,24,Pam
Does it save time though? ‘Cause we’ve been here for about an hour.,8,2,Jim
Oh yes! Yeah!,8,22,Dwight
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",5,17,Pam
We would have twins.,7,4,Michael
"You know, can I call you back?Andy and",6,17,Jim
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!,7,21,Dwight
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?,8,18,Dwight
"You're what, like, 12?",6,11,Michael
I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.,5,23,Michael
"Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.",9,7,Pam
That's exactly what I said.,2,4,Dwight
Well that's not what we agreed on.,5,17,Andy
Hey Michael.,6,23,Pam
"Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.",7,11,Erin
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.,5,23,Ryan
I’m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.,9,23,Andy
"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...",7,23,Jim
That seems inconsiderate.,9,13,Jim
"Well, kids today have a very short attention span. They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily. And today they're being distracted by the other booths.",4,13,Michael
Assistant Regional Manager.,7,24,Dwight
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?,8,17,Angela
"Thank you, Dana.",2,13,Michael
"Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.",8,23,Dwight
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,6,5,Michael
"There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.",3,21,Dwight
"Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.",6,12,Michael
Frisbee-based competitions...,3,9,Jim
Yeeesh.,3,19,Michael
"And a top of the day to you too, sir.",7,7,Andy
It is.,4,8,Michael
"Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?",3,13,Kevin
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?,7,12,Michael
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,4,2,Dwight
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?,9,23,Ryan
"Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! Did you get all that?",3,20,Michael
Do you know why you never heard of it?,8,13,Andy
There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.,3,1,Michael
Have a seat. Allow me.,6,8,Dwight
"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.",3,2,Michael
"Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.",4,6,Jim
No. Don't like that.,6,14,Michael
"No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.",6,16,Pam
"Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.",6,17,Angela
Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.,4,3,Michael
"Get out of my way, Jim!",3,11,Andy
"Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?",7,14,Michael
Here we go.,3,19,Michael
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.,8,11,Dwight
Oscar is out sick.,2,13,Dwight
...in order to feed the bears.,7,21,Michael
We should break this hinge maybe.,7,17,Pam
"--sorry, you go.",8,19,Andy
I will allow that.,6,16,Michael
Yeah! Ok! Beat that! Whoo! Ok.,9,20,Dwight
"It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.",7,22,Dwight
"If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.",4,3,Michael
Flash cards.,2,11,Michael
Oh! Text from Jim. “This is...” hmm.,8,1,Pam
"Thin handsome, Michael.",2,2,Pam
Aah! This ones hot too!,5,13,Andy
Questions?,2,16,Michael
I would like that.,8,6,Andy
I don't have one.,8,19,Erin
I said happy birthday.,2,19,Pam
"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.",6,21,Dwight
This is weird with you facing the other way.,3,8,Pam
"Actually, it’s pronounced “espresso”… Wait. That’s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So…",9,11,Oscar
Fun.,9,12,Darryl
"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.GPS Make the next right turn.",4,2,Dwight
Nope.,4,5,Jim
"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",6,10,Michael
"MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can.",3,17,Michael
Perfect.,3,9,Jim
I chose my words very carefully.,9,13,Dwight
"Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.",6,16,Kevin
"Okay, no, I am not. Dwight!  I want you to take Jim's chair. No! No! His chair at his desk. He gets it back on Friday.",5,1,Michael
"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.",5,8,Andy
"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",2,16,Michael
How does it end?,4,6,Oscar
Hey.,2,9,Jim
Are you gonna eat with us?,2,9,Kevin
"Stanley, you're suppose to close.",7,13,Andy
What did we write?,4,12,Phyllis
That does sound fun to me.,7,9,Michael
"Oh, can you imagine?",5,8,Michael
Darryl Rogers?,1,5,Ryan
"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!",3,2,Michael
"Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.",2,20,Dwight
Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!,5,1,Michael
We want to dance with you.,9,22,Erin
"Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.",2,4,Jim
You really don't have his phone number?,4,11,Jim
"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.",5,13,Andy
"Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.",2,7,Jim
"Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.",5,4,Phyllis
I see Esther's back in town.,9,17,Dwight
Jim?,6,3,Pam
Many small time make big time.,8,2,Kevin
I thought you were already engaged.,5,2,Oscar
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.,9,14,Oscar
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.,9,14,Pam
"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",7,15,Pam
Did somebody call Hank?,5,9,Pam
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!,5,15,Angela
"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",4,7,Michael
Yes?,7,21,Michael
What punch?,6,8,Michael
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.,2,13,Michael
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.,8,3,Darryl
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.,9,8,Dwight
"Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.",9,12,Erin
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?,4,11,Ryan
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.,6,23,Andy
"Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",6,6,Jim
No do not touch it!,3,19,Darryl
Great.,7,11,Pam
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.,2,20,Michael
"This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",2,5,Dwight
"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to",8,14,Andy
"Andy, come on.",8,24,Jim
Good one.,5,17,Jim
Trick question. There was no second man on the moon.,3,23,Andy
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.,8,9,Erin
"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.",3,8,Jim
You throat-rip.,9,3,Dwight
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.,8,20,Andy
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed.,6,4,Andy
And you're fired...,9,16,Andy
"Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.",3,13,Andy
"I can't be your monkey, Dwight.",9,16,Angela
Oh. Terrible idea.,2,3,Dwight
We gotta find it before it eggs.,8,16,Dwight
"Look, I feel you okay? That guy took no responsibility for his actions.",5,2,Ryan
"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.",9,1,Jim
Is there any mustard?,3,22,Phyllis
"It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.",3,22,Andy
"Okay, Dwight, come on. You can go first.",8,7,Jim
"Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...",2,4,Dwight
"""It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.""",2,11,Jim
"Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?",5,19,Kevin
"My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said ""Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!"" and she said that we're done.",5,16,Kevin
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.,5,10,Phyllis
"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.",2,20,Michael
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.,5,21,Jim
Yeah?,3,6,Michael
"Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?",3,18,Phyllis
To do something about-,2,8,Dwight
Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.,2,9,Jim
Are there any messages?,3,13,Jim
No you do not.,6,4,Dwight
She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?,6,4,Michael
"Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog.  Oh, no! Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer",5,3,Dwight
"Okay, I was just looking out for you. You're doing great, by the way.",5,26,Andy
"We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?",6,16,Michael
"No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?",5,19,Michael
The ocean.,2,18,Jim
"It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.",2,1,Dwight
"Hey. The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount. So whattaya say?  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be. Well, I can stay here all night if I have to. I've done it before.Pizza guy I'm not scared of you.",4,3,Dwight
"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",7,5,Michael
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.,5,6,Angela
"Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.",1,6,Michael
"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?",7,24,Andy
"I do like it, actually.",3,8,Angela
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.,1,3,Pam
How could I not have realized?,3,20,Andy
What's the news?,6,9,Pam
Can I have your pencils?,3,8,Kevin
"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.",7,19,Dwight
It is not just coffee.,7,10,Andy
"Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.",8,5,Andy
No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--,6,8,Michael
"Can I have a word with you, Jim?",5,16,Michael
"I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.",7,5,Andy
Give me your job.,8,3,Darryl
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.,5,17,Darryl
You know there's a ghost in this office,5,21,Dwight
Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.,2,8,Jim
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?,5,17,Pam
"All right. Cool, well... thanks.Graphics guy Sure.",4,13,Pam
"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",1,5,Dwight
"Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.",9,7,Phyllis
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.,2,12,Michael
I don't do drugs!,9,4,Andy
"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.",6,3,Michael
Uncanny.,9,22,Jim
"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.",3,10,Michael
"Well, I should go.",5,2,Pam
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.,5,24,Jim
Seriously? Are you being serious?,5,23,Pam
"Gosh, I hope so.",8,24,Andy
"No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.",3,20,Michael
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.,8,10,Angela
What? No way!,6,4,Dwight
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,4,10,Michael
"Dwight, you can’t go. You have a problem with women. You can’t sell to them.",9,7,Phyllis
How are your sales doin'?,6,2,Michael
-give him to me and... perfect.,8,24,Jim
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.,3,21,Ryan
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.,7,6,Kevin
"Leave, get outta here.",6,23,Dwight
"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?",1,4,Dwight
"I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.",6,12,Dwight
"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.",1,2,Michael
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.,6,23,Ryan
"Its over, Michael, its over.",5,12,Dwight
"We're just friends, okay?",7,23,Andy
Got it. Dually noted. You! Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?,8,3,Andy
I have so many people to thank for this award.,2,1,Pam
Trip Advsior.,4,4,Pam
No! No way! It... no.,2,10,Michael
"My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...",1,4,Oscar
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.,5,6,Jim
"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.",4,4,Dwight
You know that’s…,8,5,Jim
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,7,10,Dwight
Such as?,6,22,Andy
I... Just... Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,2,3,Michael
"Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.",4,3,Dwight
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. They use a watch repair kit.,9,15,Angela
Would you like to buy some cookies?,8,18,Darryl
"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.",6,2,Pam
Still decorative.,9,8,Jim
"It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.",6,7,Michael
"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.",2,12,Pam
"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",4,3,Jim
"Go ahead David, I’m listening.",9,7,Jim
Right here! Right here! Michael and,3,7,Michael
"I was stupid, I told him.",5,16,Oscar
I think that's mold.,3,11,Pam
It costs about $75 per person.,6,2,Pam
"Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...",5,16,Pam
Dwight does not play a robot.,7,16,Michael
Are you really sure we should be leaving?Hospital employee Yeah.,6,16,Jim
You be cool.,5,22,Michael
"Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.",2,7,Dwight
"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",3,13,Michael
Why aren't you in New York?,4,3,Oscar
"Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.",8,15,Andy
That's not a baby.,5,3,Michael
"Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?",4,11,Jim
"Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up.",6,9,Angela
Are you seeing anyone right now?,6,4,Kevin
"No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.",2,14,Jim
"Ha ha. That’d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get… What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn’t I think of this? Andy’s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I’m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?",9,11,Pam
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.,2,2,Kevin
"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.",7,1,Jim
500.,5,4,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.",6,8,Dwight
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.,8,9,Andy
"No, I'm not gonna do that.",6,12,Jim
Went well?,1,6,Jim
"Oh, guys, it’s starting! Hurry!",9,19,Erin
"Oh, really? Uh-huh.",2,18,Dwight
"This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--",5,24,Michael
"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",6,5,Andy
That's because they're easy!,5,17,Dwight
How's it going? Good day?,6,11,Ryan
"Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there.",8,19,Erin
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,8,13,Jim
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.,5,20,Jim
I can't wait to meet him.,8,15,Ryan
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.,9,14,Darryl
Very well.,6,16,Dwight
You ready for your interview?,9,11,Pam
"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",6,15,Michael
I think I saw it!,8,16,Dwight
"Jim, don't interfere.",2,1,Dwight
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.,6,5,Michael
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,2,20,Dwight
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?,2,1,Jim
"It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry.",1,5,Michael
That was helping. It was classic.,5,17,Michael
It's too much.,3,3,Pam
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I...,2,1,Michael
"And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have. Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.",4,6,Andy
Just take the parrot.,6,6,Jim
"Thank you, Holly.",5,1,Kevin
Brilliant!,9,3,Pam
"Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?",6,9,Michael
What?,6,15,Michael
You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.,2,1,Michael
"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",4,2,Michael
"Okay, I believe you, I believe you.",6,24,Michael
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?,9,23,Darryl
"So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...",3,11,Michael
"This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",2,15,Michael
What's wrong with me?,4,3,Michael
"I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.",9,10,Oscar
"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?",8,13,Dwight
"No antigravity machine, huh?",4,14,Michael
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.,8,3,Darryl
That's his profit.,1,1,Michael
"The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.",7,20,Michael
Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. So... we should probably... go.,8,20,Andy
"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",6,9,Jim
"You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.",9,3,Darryl
Pam do you think anyone’s going to notice I’ve worn this costume before? When I wasn’t pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.,8,5,Angela
"Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",9,14,Pam
I love this hog mama.,9,9,Kevin
And I was about to take her bra off...,2,1,Michael
"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?",9,11,Dwight
"Mm, no...",5,9,Michael
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.,9,14,Dwight
"Oh, I have a flush!",2,22,Phyllis
"Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.",4,4,Andy
"Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.Mr.",1,2,Michael
"Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...",2,1,Michael
You mean where my desk is?,2,2,Kevin
"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",7,11,Pam
Hey!,7,22,Jim
Do you think they have any s'mores?,3,6,Michael
"Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. Are you going later?",6,19,Andy
Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,2,15,Michael
"Sure, no problem.",9,11,Pam
They really do that.,7,15,Dwight
"So, okay.",2,11,Michael
"Forget it, man.",8,18,Darryl
Next exit isn't for five miles.,5,5,Darryl
But that's illegal.,2,20,Dwight
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.,8,24,Pam
"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J�rg Ro�kopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.",4,8,Dwight
"We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.",9,15,Erin
"Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.",9,2,Erin
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.,2,19,Dwight
"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  Oh, that's my new ""Dwight"" ring.",5,23,Jim
Against who?,5,24,Michael
"Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.",9,10,Kevin
"Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!",1,5,Michael
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk. Did you ever think of that?,4,1,Michael
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?,9,14,Darryl
"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",2,13,Dwight
"Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.",9,16,Dwight
Check this out.,7,9,Ryan
What about a cat eating man food?,4,12,Andy
"Pam, information is power.",1,1,Dwight
"Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.",5,12,Michael
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!,5,22,Michael
It is really special.,6,4,Jim
"Oh, yeah, totally.",3,7,Ryan
"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.",2,8,Dwight
"Yeah, there you go.",7,14,Phyllis
"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",2,21,Pam
"Oh, yeah, so we’ll just do that later.",9,13,Jim
"Oh, how did that happen?",5,13,Dwight
OK.,4,1,Michael
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!,5,15,Dwight
That's no accident.,8,10,Oscar
"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?",2,7,Jim
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?,7,13,Jim
"Yes, they do.",4,4,Jim
"Hmm, what?",3,11,Jim
"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.",6,4,Jim
"Hey, this is better.",9,23,Kevin
"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",6,12,Michael
Darryl is a jerk.,7,15,Andy

"Talk to you later-- Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this.",6,3,Michael
Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,6,22,Pam
Andy sings beautifully. And he’s really good at dancing. He’s a good speaker. But there’s just something there you don’t want to look at.,9,21,Phyllis
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.,6,16,Dwight

They act like I have no power.,6,18,Michael
I asked you a question.,7,14,Dwight
"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",4,7,Michael
"Stop, stop! Oh, my god! Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",7,5,Michael
"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",6,5,Michael
Where’s Angela?,8,2,Pam
"No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.",3,18,Michael
"Oh, um. Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.",9,15,Jim
An antacid that you only take once a week.,7,10,Kevin
"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.",6,23,Dwight
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.,6,1,Michael
"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",2,12,Jim
"That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It’s like a festival of poo.",8,23,Andy
Please? Just make sure he's OK?,9,4,Pam
"Take care, man.",7,24,Ryan
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.,5,9,Oscar

"But you hear the baby crying, right?Hospital employee Mm-hmm... Where's your car?",6,16,Jim
Mmm hmm.,1,3,Jim
"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.",4,8,Michael
"All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. Whoo!",7,9,Jim
"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.",2,3,Michael
"Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?",4,3,Oscar

You got dumped?,9,10,Phyllis
Well that's a sales desk.,8,9,Erin
"I'm just doing my job, man.",4,5,Jim
"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?",4,8,Jim
"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",2,11,Pam
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!,9,16,Andy
I didn't apologize.,3,20,Angela
My money's on Pam.,6,8,Kevin
"Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?",5,3,Michael
I left my cell phone in my car.,4,10,Andy
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,8,13,Dwight
"He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.",2,14,Michael
I don't know what you mean.,2,13,Jim
"Yeah, pretty stationery.",2,21,Phyllis
Go! Go! Go!,7,11,Jim

We were robbed last night.,5,4,Jim
Is it Stanley?,5,22,Michael
I vouched for you.,1,5,Michael
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,8,13,Dwight
"Okay, ""A,"" Halbert. And, ""B,"" I think a more appropriate statement would be, ""The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.""",7,7,Jim
"My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",7,10,Michael
Everything.,7,21,Angela
Good shocks.,2,4,Dwight
"I'm so sorry, Michael.",5,15,Pam

But I do like her just the way she is.,5,17,Kevin
'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,7,17,Dwight

I thought you were at your sister's funeral.,8,5,Andy
What color do you guys think?,1,4,Angela
"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.",4,7,Andy

How do I explain this to Jan?,3,6,Michael
"Good morning, Michael.",2,2,Pam
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... Everyone is listening to me.,7,24,Kevin

Are you talking to me?,7,7,Michael
Good Lord! I can't believe I'm missing this.,6,17,Jim

"Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only",6,18,Dwight
So stupid!,6,1,Michael
She's amazing. This is very exciting.,7,18,Jim
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?,6,17,Dwight
"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.",6,5,Andy
"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",9,15,Dwight
"In business school, Kevin. Business school.",3,16,Michael

"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...",7,11,Pam

"Okay, can I have that?",7,1,Michael
... and I feel free!,5,19,Michael
"Hey Uncle Lucas, it’s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it’s different because it’s your wife?  Well, that doesn’t make any sense to me.",8,17,Ryan
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.,7,21,Pam

"Oh, why not?",2,17,Dwight
"I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me. Am I in pain? Hell, yeah. But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain. I love pain. To me, pain is not pain at all. No. It is pure pleasure. And I hate pleasure. Almost as much as I love pain. So, yeah, I'm in pain.",4,3,Dwight
What?,6,5,Michael
Andy.,7,15,Erin
"I like it, I like it!",8,2,Ryan
"His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.",3,11,Michael
"Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.",3,2,Michael

Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.,2,1,Jim
It'll be ready soon.,5,19,Pam
I'm not making any copies.,1,3,Pam
You did?,4,14,Michael
"No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.",4,2,Ryan
"Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...",1,2,Pam

Some people.,4,6,Pam

"Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!",9,11,Darryl
How's your hearing?,7,23,Phyllis
"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.",2,7,Pam
"Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.",1,5,Michael
"Well, I second that emotion.",8,22,Jim
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,4,2,Dwight
Sure you can't stay a little longer?,5,3,Michael
"Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?",9,6,Dwight
"It's all good, we got this.",8,13,Darryl
I'm thinking cow-,8,6,Pam
"Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?",7,7,Andy
Dwight just listen! It's underneath...,6,16,Pam
"Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...",2,11,Michael
Bowling.,5,16,Phyllis

"Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...",7,9,Michael
Not relevant.,4,1,Pam
"Yep, yep.",6,14,Pam
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.,4,9,Pam
Guys! Guys! Guys!,8,14,Andy
That's ok. It's ok.,2,9,Pam
It is my duty...,2,20,Dwight

"Yeah, sounds good. Ok.",9,18,Pam
"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",8,13,Jim
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,7,11,Pam
"I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works.  I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.",3,4,Michael
You're clearly snooping.,9,16,Oscar
It was.,6,6,Jim
Look at that. Bob ordered hot food.,5,16,Jim
That's... that's... that's very generous.,1,4,Oscar
"This is not funny, man, let me down.",8,4,Ryan
"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet.  Do your job!",5,24,Angela
"Absolutely, I will.",9,2,Dwight
Three times.,8,10,Jim
"You weren't even moving. Okay, sub!",5,26,Dwight
"Well it is business, but not as usual.",4,2,Ryan
Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.,7,15,Erin
"OK, we'll be skins!",1,5,Dwight
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.,7,15,Ryan
Just get in the car.,6,5,Michael
Did you just buy that?,4,14,Pam
"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.",5,20,Michael
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,6,18,Jim
"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",1,1,Michael
"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",6,22,Michael
Well...,3,18,Michael
It's an epidemic.,1,3,Pam
"But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!",3,1,Michael
"I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word ""perfect"" in here!",4,14,Pam
No!,4,14,Michael
"No. Oh, all right.",5,14,Michael
Great. See you upstairs.,5,24,Jim

Nice comeback!,3,8,Andy
They're good,6,21,Michael
Really?,2,8,Michael
You’re bad.,9,21,Dwight
What was that?,6,21,Jim
Is it true you're buying the company?,8,24,Phyllis
"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.",3,2,Michael
"Ok, I get it.",2,16,Dwight
"Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.",3,12,Pam
"Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.",9,6,Erin
"Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.",6,16,Pam
"Yeah, yeah. Exactly.",9,18,Jim
That was your idea.,5,17,Dwight
"Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.",3,16,Jim
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-,9,18,Pam

And dental this time.,5,23,Michael
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!,9,20,Erin

No. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let us lose me.,9,12,Dwight
Reach your arms out.,5,8,Pam

"Oh come on, man! Believe in something.",5,11,Kevin
"Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.",2,3,Jim

"Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.",3,6,Phyllis
"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",4,1,Michael
Your nose?,6,7,Michael
"No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.",4,1,Pam
I thought that's what you were doing.,9,14,Erin
Yeah?,2,18,Michael
Okay.,6,8,Michael
I think I just got flashed.,3,21,Phyllis
"Hey, you don't have to...",7,15,Jim
Please stop making me do these things.,5,10,Angela
It's deleted.,5,15,Pam
Wear something nice.,4,2,Ryan
"Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me.",9,6,Oscar
"On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed. On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",4,1,Michael
I'm gonna pull the car around.,2,12,Jim
Cause that's...,4,14,Michael

"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.",4,8,Michael
"Hi. All right. Travel safe, Angela.",7,7,Jim
Ok.,6,7,Michael
"Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.",8,8,Darryl
Allergy to... the desk?,2,14,Jim
"Yes, I'm gay.",3,1,Oscar

Dreaming he's a dog on a island.,7,14,Darryl
"I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time. But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk. I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals. Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are. Big marble... jerk stand.",4,12,Michael

"What a weird day. I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life. Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.

"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.",5,8,Dwight

Whose your favorite iron chef?,8,6,Andy
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.,6,20,Erin

"Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!",2,1,Michael

I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",4,14,Jim
"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...",1,4,Jim

"Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.",5,6,Andy
Shrute! Shrute!,9,6,Dwight
"I'm not familiar with that expression,",5,12,Dwight
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?,2,8,Dwight
"Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",5,8,Michael
Did I? I don't...,4,11,Jim
"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.",1,2,Pam
It's his first day back.,3,8,Kevin
Smells like it.,6,10,Dwight
"I don't know, what?",2,1,Jim
He's a purple belt. That's really high.,2,6,Pam
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on.,4,7,Dwight
"Okay, how's that?",7,23,Dwight
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.,8,10,Jim
Lice. More lice. Angela has lice.,9,10,Erin

Yes! Yes! I would love to!,6,19,Pam
"Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being ""lured"" these days. Thank you Dateline!",4,13,Michael
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.,9,20,Pam
"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.",4,12,Michael
"Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",4,6,Michael
"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.",5,11,Michael
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.,4,10,Dwight
"No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.",6,16,Dwight
Then why don't you do something about it?,9,4,Kevin
"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.",8,6,Jim
"So Phyllis is basically saying, ""Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth."" I gave Ryan an iPod.",2,10,Michael
"Oh, yeah, my water broke.",6,16,Pam
Montana.,4,9,Pam

Yeah. He's in rehab actually.,9,6,Andy
"Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.",3,8,Michael
"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.",2,20,Dwight
"Aw, come on. What's the harm? Mmm. What flavor was that?",8,24,Darryl
"No, no. That is right now.",7,10,Michael
"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?",2,5,Michael
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?,1,3,Dwight
"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",6,3,Pam
"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",1,3,Dwight
"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",3,5,Dwight
Pam... PAAAM!?,2,12,Michael
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.,2,20,Pam
"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.",8,10,Jim
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,5,17,Jim
"Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...",2,11,Jim
Not it.,4,3,Jim
"It was before, my tech- my technical training.",6,5,Andy
What? Oh.,3,21,Michael
"Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it. Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things. So... best to just lay off.",4,4,Dwight
Previously on Varsity Blues...,3,3,Michael
"We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...",6,15,Ryan
"OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????",8,3,Ryan
Phyllis. You're a married woman.,3,21,Angela

See you later.,6,10,Michael
Dwight-,2,7,Jim
Here we are outside-,6,7,Pam
"Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.",2,4,Dwight
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little inspiration.,9,2,Darryl
Thank you Pam.,7,17,Erin
Only if you tell me what you're writing.,2,16,Jim
No. God. You go talk to him.,6,23,Michael
Did you break the shredder Kevin?,7,21,Jim
"What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.",2,11,Darryl
It is worth it.,2,10,Darryl
"Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.",5,3,Phyllis
"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?",3,23,Michael
"Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-",9,16,Pam
No. The monkey!,7,15,Michael
"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?",9,14,Jim
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He’s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I’ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight…only good surprises. “Guten Pranken”.,9,23,Jim
"Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.",5,22,Michael
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.,5,25,Jim
Mm-hmm.,5,23,Pam
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.,7,4,Michael
"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.",4,2,Jim
Oh my god. Was she cute?,6,24,Michael
"No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.",1,5,Michael
Queen's higher.,2,13,Dwight
Courtside seats. Sixers.,9,2,Jim
You want me to flush him?,3,4,Dwight
It's a divet...,9,16,Dwight
Because you're engaged to Andy.,5,11,Dwight
Okay.,5,15,Michael
You what?,3,10,Jim
"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.",9,1,Dwight
"It could be badass. Yeah, it will.",4,6,Michael
"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you’ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.",9,1,Andy
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.,3,13,Andy
"Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?",5,8,Pam
"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we’re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I’m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So… problem solved. Thanks, guys.",9,13,Jim
"Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.",3,13,Michael
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.,7,10,Phyllis
"Wha? Oh, burn. Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?",9,16,Andy
"Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.",8,13,Pam
I've done it all my life.,7,24,Erin
"You just made a good idea, a great idea.",8,11,Darryl
How old's Kelly?,5,14,Jim
"Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...",6,3,Ryan
"No, no, you saw through me, great.",2,13,Jim
"Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.",3,11,Michael
All right. Girl in 2nd club So I'll see ya soon.,4,11,Michael
"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit Complicit. You were all successories!",6,18,Michael
Perform a test.,9,22,Jim
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.,6,7,Andy
"I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.",8,4,Darryl
"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",6,22,Dwight
Here we go. Alright!,3,14,Michael
"No wait, what are you doing?!",3,23,Dwight
"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.",8,3,Jim
"Smart as a whip! Yes! These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",3,22,Michael
"Obviously. He’s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he’s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.",9,8,Kevin
"No, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.",5,1,Michael
What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.,6,16,Andy
Anything. Good. Yup.,1,6,Jim
"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.",2,6,Michael
Bull man!,4,5,Michael
"Oh, hey what is this?",5,12,Michael
"Darryl, would you do the honors?",5,1,Michael
People love beets.,2,3,Dwight
"He has not stopped working for a second. At 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 132 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today.",5,2,Jim
You're gonna lose all of our money.,7,9,Andy
That is what I'm showing you.,8,8,Andy
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.,7,23,Jim
"Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.",7,15,Phyllis
Stop hitting me!,9,18,Oscar
I'm gonna go to my desk.,4,11,Jim
I got shotgun. Damn it.,3,21,Michael
"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",2,22,Jim
"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.",2,19,Jim
"Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?",9,18,Pam
"Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.",3,22,Michael

I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.,7,14,Michael
Thanks Dad…Darryl.,9,23,Andy
"What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...",7,11,Darryl

"You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",6,23,Dwight
"This is awesome. Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.",7,3,Erin
"Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours.",5,16,Jim
Always.,3,4,Dwight
Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.,4,5,Andy
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.,9,14,Pam
"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",2,13,Michael
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.,7,12,Michael
Clean sack.,6,18,Dwight
My name is Angela.,2,4,Angela
Two more.,2,6,Dwight

Approved!,8,5,Andy
Mm-hmm.,9,21,Pam
"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?",5,10,Michael
That's a conflict of interest.,5,5,Dwight
N-no there's not.,4,14,Dwight
Misdemeanor?,3,2,Dwight
"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.",2,1,Dwight
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,4,5,Michael

"Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True— Oh no.",9,3,Jim
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.,7,23,Dwight
"What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?",2,3,Ryan
"Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of...",6,11,Michael
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,6,10,Jim
"Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",6,23,Michael
I think you have me confused with another person.,5,4,Angela
I would like another alcohol.,8,10,Erin
"So that's the problem, is solved. What?",2,3,Michael
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.,3,8,Dwight
"Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?",8,17,Kevin
"Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? OK. He's back! OK. Hmm. Waagh!",3,21,Michael

Great.,9,14,Pam
Oh! Well...,5,18,Michael
The space dust does it.,9,18,Darryl
"I haven’t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he’s always like, “Beesly!” I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- “Beesly!”",9,12,Pam
"Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!",5,3,Dwight
"Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.",5,22,Dwight
What's the joke?,5,1,Oscar
...talk about it.,4,1,Jim
What's it... why are you crying?,6,6,Michael
"The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.",7,9,Ryan
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?,7,4,Oscar
You playing that game again?,4,5,Jim

Very inspirational.,4,4,Michael
"Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.",5,14,Michael
Let it go.,7,9,Pam
This is all we have.,6,12,Jim

Like that?,6,21,Kevin
"I knew you would, Nancy.",3,14,Dwight

I'm Michael. We dated for a while.,7,4,Michael
There’s actually not a rule that says that.,8,23,Jim
"No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.",3,10,Michael
"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",7,11,Pam
"Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...",4,7,Michael

"He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.",7,24,Phyllis
"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",3,2,Jim

"I know. But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",8,12,Dwight
Did he not tell you that?,6,19,Angela
Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?,5,3,Andy
Yeah.,5,20,Michael
"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.",6,21,Jim
People have been filtering in and out.,3,2,Michael
"Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could’ve choked so many people by now.",8,23,Dwight
After you.,7,2,Andy
There's an HR meeting in there at 1130.,1,6,Pam
"Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry.",7,19,Michael
Cameras...,8,9,Andy
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.,5,4,Phyllis
"Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?",2,12,Michael
"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...",2,5,Michael
Forget that.,6,8,Michael
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.",6,4,Michael
Just getting a tea bag.,1,5,Darryl
"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.",6,15,Dwight
It's the four of hearts.,8,20,Jim
No. I think I will pass.,4,14,Michael
"Yes, that's true.",5,5,Angela
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.,3,23,Jim
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.,1,1,Michael
Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.,3,3,Michael
"Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.",4,14,Pam
"No, no, no.",6,23,Michael
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...,1,1,Pam
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,6,3,Jim
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.,5,17,Dwight
"Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It’s very unlikely it would happen again. Mr.",9,12,Darryl
He needs help balancing some travel receipts.,4,8,Pam
I would do the same for you.,6,4,Michael
"Step 5, ...the wound.",3,23,Dwight
What's a bad idea?,7,6,Michael
We call it Hate Ball.,2,3,Kevin
That's an overreaction.,2,5,Jim
"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",6,9,Michael
Don't you mean constructive criticism?,2,8,Ryan
"Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.",6,6,Erin
"All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.",8,8,Andy
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.,6,7,Jim
"Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?",2,13,Jim
"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!",3,10,Dwight

Stop it. Stop it.,3,12,Michael
Yep.,4,13,Jim
Actually not. It was really so-so.,5,2,Jim
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.,5,15,Michael
You have no idea...,2,22,Pam
"Oh, the Nets are super tough.",9,10,Kevin
Why would Michael give you one before me?,2,8,Dwight
"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",7,11,Pam
Athleap.,9,23,Jim
"Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.",5,3,Dwight
"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",4,1,Michael
"We're going bankrupt, you think? They are really angry.",6,10,Michael
... I asked for trick candles.,2,19,Michael
Can you put that down?,9,22,Angela
Where are we going this afternoon?,2,11,Phyllis
YOLO!,9,11,Oscar

Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.,5,21,Jim
About 2 months,9,23,Pam
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.,6,21,Pam
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.,7,24,Andy
Does my room have cable?,3,23,Jim
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,6,2,Michael
"Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?",9,4,Pam
Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,3,23,Michael
"Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.",9,14,Darryl
I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...,2,11,Michael
Just let go.,5,20,Michael

"Yep, good.",8,7,Pam
"Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.",9,8,Angela
Creed! Come on. Stanley!,2,19,Dwight
"Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma’s got breakfast, OK? We are going to Roy’s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife’s ex-fiancé’s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it’s your wife’s ex-fiancé.",9,2,Jim
Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.,2,12,Pam
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!,3,20,Dwight
"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-",8,20,Andy
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.,2,1,Dwight
"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?",5,9,Kevin
I sell more paper than anyone.,5,6,Dwight
"Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?",6,6,Pam
Whose hands are these? Theyre not my hands. I don’t know.,9,8,Phyllis
"Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.",9,9,Dwight
"Clark has no chance. I mean, he’s up against my buddy Rolf, for God’s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he’ll make you laugh so hard, you’ll puke your pants.",9,13,Dwight
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?,8,1,Andy
"We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It’s like everything I did, he just wouldn’t go for it.",9,12,Jim
"Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.",3,23,Dwight
Enjoying your nut?,6,7,Kevin
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?,4,1,Ryan
We should think about this…does anyone have any better ideas?,8,2,Andy
"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.",4,12,Michael
B-9.,7,15,Andy
"I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.",5,19,Michael
"Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?",7,20,Darryl
"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..",6,20,Michael
Okay.,3,20,Michael
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...,2,17,Michael
"Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?",8,4,Dwight
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.,4,1,Pam
"You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.",9,3,Andy

It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!,3,19,Darryl
"Oh, you say that every time.",2,4,Phyllis
"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",2,8,Michael
"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?",7,10,Erin
Yeah.  She's fine.,5,16,Jim
Baby carrots.,6,9,Michael
"Yes, thank you for seeing that.",3,19,Michael
In my sleep.,4,8,Pam
"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.",5,13,Michael
Where are all the animals?,3,5,Dwight
You should go.,2,3,Dwight
"Isn't it supposed to be, ""Drive safely""?",8,6,Kevin

Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.,8,10,Jim

"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.",6,16,Pam
"Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.",5,21,Pam
"Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.",3,23,Dwight

"Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we’re about to do?",9,19,Dwight
I don't think she'd be missed.,1,4,Dwight
"Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.",5,12,Pam
"Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.",3,14,Jim
"Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.",8,22,Ryan
That's what I've heard.,7,19,Michael
It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.,9,4,Oscar
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.,3,11,Pam

"No, you may not.",7,7,Michael
"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",3,8,Michael

"So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?",1,4,Jim
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.,9,2,Darryl

"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.",9,15,Andy
"I got into Cornell off the Wait List. A lot of people were like, ""Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building."" No. Okay. I got into Cornell because I'm smart. I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.",4,6,Andy
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,5,13,Pam
"Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.",5,15,Michael
"Sounds like a plan, Sugar.",6,9,Erin
"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished.",2,14,Michael
"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said ""Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of"".",2,8,Dwight
"Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.",5,5,Angela
‘cause I feel like I’m gonna fall off.,8,17,Ryan
Are we over budget?,7,11,Michael
Was it nice?,5,23,Michael
Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,6,16,Dwight
"OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",3,21,Michael
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.,2,16,Dwight
How much did you pay for it?,4,1,Jim
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?,5,25,Michael
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.,3,6,Pam
Shoot!,4,4,Pam
Specific shout-out..,6,20,Andy
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.,8,15,Erin
"Okay, did you get it out of your system.",4,6,Oscar
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away.,7,10,Andy
A credit.,2,4,Ryan
"Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",6,22,Pam
"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",6,23,Pam
Didn't I?,7,20,Jim
"They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case.",5,13,Michael
Oooh!,4,13,Kevin
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.,3,6,Pam
"Hey, can you not?",5,1,Jim
It is possible that I could be talking about us.,5,22,Dwight
"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",4,7,Jim
And it’s getting a little more serious. She’s never come by.,8,5,Andy
"Oh, thanks.",4,12,Pam
"Okay, I am not dying here. Come on.",5,13,Jim
In this climate?,5,19,Andy
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.,2,12,Jim
It explains so much.,3,1,Angela
It's going to be okay.,2,19,Oscar
"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",6,5,Michael
"Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.",8,19,Erin
"Well, w…",9,23,Kevin
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...,1,2,Michael
"No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.",7,13,Ryan
"""Ciao"" Right? ""Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.""",6,20,Kevin
"I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.  Don't avoid this. I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.",4,3,Michael
Yes. How did he do?,7,24,Darryl
ROY!,3,18,Pam
Doesn't Jan have money?,4,4,Pam
"Beesly, are you threatening me?",5,9,Jim
Do you know anybody in the mob?,4,4,Michael
"Michael, go ahead, we're listening.",3,19,Andy
Don't we all?,1,1,Pam
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!,7,21,Dwight
"OK, temp.",3,22,Dwight
"Yeah, that—you're being really mean, Andy.",9,3,Kevin
"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.",8,19,Jim
"Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.",8,10,Erin
No it is not.,2,3,Michael
"Well, is that really a priority?",2,6,Pam
Extreme! Parkour!,6,1,Dwight
"Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.",4,13,Jim
Like the movie.,7,5,Michael
"Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?",3,4,Michael
"If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.",7,7,Andy
"It blows. It blows, man. Gah...",2,15,Michael
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!,7,8,Oscar
"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?",4,10,Jim
"K, Kevin, are you saying “See the world”? or “Sea World?”",8,2,Jim
"Oh my God, he's really in pain.",4,5,Pam
What does 2005 season mean?,2,3,Jim
"I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.",9,6,Oscar
I wish I could menstruate.,3,21,Dwight
Parley?,7,10,Pam
"Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.",6,12,Michael
"Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.",7,22,Ryan
"A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?",6,19,Andy
"Stanley, are you listening to music?",8,15,Jim
"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",2,10,Dwight
"No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. No body go in there. Stay where you are.",7,19,Michael
Probably another high-school student.,3,20,Jim
Jan is smart.,4,4,Oscar
Surprise!De,7,20,Michael
Kevin!,9,6,Oscar
I'll be six.,5,9,Michael
I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,6,22,Michael
Everybody enjoying their meal?,4,9,Michael
"What you need flour for, Jim?",9,14,Darryl
"""You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-""",2,1,Michael
"Deangelo, did you order a barber?",7,19,Erin
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!,7,8,Erin
"I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.",5,3,Michael
Who is it?,3,9,Pam
Give me the bottle!!,2,12,Michael
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.,5,13,Michael
"Yeah, I know what a loft is.",5,23,Pam
Get lost.,7,18,Michael
"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...",2,2,Jim
What is the antidote?,8,15,Dwight
Okay.,6,14,Michael
"So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-",6,19,Jim
AHHHH!,3,17,Michael
"No, Stanley, do you -",6,18,Ryan
"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.",2,11,Dwight
"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.",4,7,Jim
"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.",8,14,Kevin
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.,5,16,Michael
Do you need us for any of this?,5,4,Jim
I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...,2,11,Michael
I Braveheart. I am.,3,19,Michael
What?,2,2,Michael
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,4,1,Michael
Blackula!,7,6,Michael
That is not current.,3,21,Michael
"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.",2,6,Michael
"They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.",4,3,Andy
Eager.,5,11,Dwight
"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",9,15,Andy
"No it's not, not like penis-wise. Hello little boy, what's your name?",6,12,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.",5,7,Dwight
"...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...",3,9,Jim
"No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.",9,4,Pam
"I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?",5,22,Jim
"Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.",5,4,Michael
"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",2,5,Jim
I take full responsibility.,7,23,Dwight
"Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.",5,21,Dwight
"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...Mrs.",6,14,Michael
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,6,8,Dwight
"Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.",7,19,Kevin
"Yeah, I am too.",2,4,Jim
"There you are, my friend.",5,24,Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  Ah.",3,18,Darryl
Give me the phone.,5,6,Michael
"Michael, get off the floor!",5,15,Pam
"No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.",4,7,Angela
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. Less paste.,9,20,Kevin
Three Kings.,8,5,Darryl
Goodbye.,6,16,Angela
A throne for your highness.,5,13,Andy
"Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?",9,4,Andy
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.,7,5,Jim
Close.,9,22,Erin
Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.,3,11,Michael
"Oh, don't be such a baby.",7,11,Phyllis
Ok. Bye Harvey.,3,12,Pam
"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?",2,19,Michael
"Oooh, okay. That was still about me.",2,2,Michael
"Listen, I don’t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I’ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.",8,17,Andy
"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle.",5,8,Andy
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?,3,8,Andy
"Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...",4,14,Jim
"None of your business, Jim.",4,4,Dwight
I can’t. I have the thing.,9,7,Jim
Yes. Jim...,6,1,Michael
Or get hit by a car-,2,9,Dwight
See what I mean?,3,3,Andy
"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.",6,16,Michael
"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.",2,10,Dwight
"Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that’s gonna take?",9,21,Jim
"Oh, I’m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.",9,23,Phyllis
Best Dundies ever.,2,1,Dwight
Do we have a conversation scheduled?,6,6,Jim
"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.",1,3,Michael
"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.",1,2,Michael
"Show them what you brought, Mike.",4,13,Darryl
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,7,6,Jim
"Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.",5,3,Darryl
Are you proposing!?,7,18,Pam
Time to have a little kiss!,8,20,Andy
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.,3,10,Michael
She's engaged.,2,11,Jim
Other than me.,4,12,Michael
"Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?",2,11,Michael
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.,1,4,Michael
"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.",1,5,Michael
Carla! Carla!,9,20,Andy
What! You knew?,6,6,Pam
Line.,4,8,Michael
That's inspired.,5,18,Jim
"Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.",9,18,Angela
"Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion.",5,3,Jim
Yes.,2,8,Michael
They don't know how.,7,7,Andy
"Oh my God, oh my God.",4,3,Michael
How do you know?,3,4,Michael
"Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours.",4,1,Michael
Really?,6,8,Michael
It’s called Ghostbusters.,8,5,Jim
I just have a quick question.,2,6,Pam
"No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.",3,22,Jim
You might be interested-,5,5,Andy
Check it out. Terminator.,2,3,Dwight
"Jim it's okay. You can t... This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it, okay. It's okay. Oh. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. Okay, well.",2,20,Michael
"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.",6,4,Dwight
"I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!",7,21,Andy
"It was great to see you, Jan.",4,14,Kevin
"Go home, Toby. Just...",3,8,Michael
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.,6,16,Jim
Stop it!,9,11,Angela
I can imagine.,4,1,Jim
I know just he place.,2,13,Michael
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?,5,20,Dwight
"Oh, yeah. She's hot.",1,2,Jim
What if it's a girl?,6,16,Angela
"So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.",7,21,Jim
"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?",4,10,Michael
"No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.",1,6,Michael
"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",5,9,Michael
"Oh, its on.",7,10,Andy
Night,9,12,Pam
What do we do?,5,13,Pam
Guy's going by. Shh.,4,6,Jim
Because we're usually not on the same page.,6,14,Pam
"And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.",3,6,Michael
"Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. Sorry. Kevin. Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.",4,14,Michael
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?,8,12,Andy
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.,7,2,Jim
"Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...",2,17,Pam
I will do my regional manager job to the best of my capability.,3,1,Michael
"Nice, very nice.",2,22,Dwight
"Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics. Why isn't the company doing better? Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week. Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance. I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.",5,2,Oscar
I just went out for a walk.,7,8,Michael
Later on.,4,3,Dwight
"But, do not worry. I have his home address right here.",3,7,Dwight
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.,6,7,Andy
Lincoln.,6,18,Jim
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?,8,2,Andy
Does he have access to their medical records?,2,9,Dwight
"Jim, no. No. No! No!",9,5,Dwight
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?,9,16,Erin
"That doesn’t sound crazy, Jim. That’s the sanest thing I’ve ever heard.",9,22,Dwight
Take it back. That is absurd.,6,12,Michael
"-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?",7,17,Andy
Ahhhh...,7,21,Michael
"I got it, try, um--",7,9,Andy
That's a common swindlers trick.,7,18,Dwight
"Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.",3,8,Jim
Oh. Is that like your new thing?,3,8,Jim
49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.,6,8,Pam
"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. Welcome. Help yourself.",3,8,Michael
"I’ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!",8,2,Andy
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.,6,4,Dwight
"I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.",3,12,Michael
Diversifying. Smart.,2,3,Dwight
"It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.",2,17,Michael
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.,1,6,Dwight
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.,1,6,Michael
I'm... leaving on June 8th.,2,17,Jim
That's not a good idea.,4,12,Jim
Hold that thought.  March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.,5,17,Dwight
Like... I don't... I don't know.,1,2,Michael
"Well the first one has a surprise factor. ""I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!""",7,14,Pam
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.,5,8,Michael
"I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.",7,9,Ryan
I wasn't. But thank you. Do you know anything about this party?,5,6,Jim
"No, no, no... no, no...",6,6,Michael
"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here.",1,1,Jim
We're in the same High School class.,2,2,Phyllis
"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.",3,7,Michael
"Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.",4,6,Michael
Let's... eh... see ya.,5,20,Jim
Wha-,8,14,Andy
"Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!",8,22,Ryan
"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.",6,10,Dwight
"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.",7,15,Michael
No! Just talk to her.,7,12,Pam
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.,8,10,Andy
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?,5,3,Oscar
"Oh, my God.",9,7,Pam
Are these numbers correct?,7,15,Michael
"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",4,4,Michael
"I could've gotten that, idiot!",5,26,Dwight
"Ah, I'll just... wait for him.",6,12,Oscar
It was insensitive and I am sorry.,7,12,Michael
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.,3,10,Pam
No.,4,7,Michael
"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",7,15,Michael
Did you check your... butt?,3,4,Andy
I don’t think I sh-,9,22,Darryl
My first order of business make Andrew Bernard my number two.,3,23,Dwight
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,2,10,Dwight
Am I too short?,2,8,Michael
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.,7,9,Ryan
That's a pun.,5,23,Michael
Why would the architect design stairs this wide? Was there an obese family in here before you?,3,17,Dwight
"Okay, and remember-you're not gay.",7,5,Dwight
Walking in the door...Mr.,5,22,Michael
"That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",6,8,Dwight
"People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.",2,20,Dwight
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.,4,11,Michael
Oof!,5,26,Pam
Which one?,2,8,Jim
"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",2,5,Michael
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...,5,8,Michael
"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?",1,1,Michael
"I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!",2,12,Michael
"In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.",9,17,Dwight
"Hey, are you kidding me?",6,16,Jim
"I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.",9,15,Andy
I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.,2,13,Michael
Does the Department of Health know about this?,4,4,Jim
"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!",7,21,Dwight
"Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That’s how you do that, baby. It’s all good, I’m ready. Y’all ready for this?",9,11,Darryl
"Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.",8,6,Kevin
"Yeah, Michael. Go Michael.",1,5,Jim
Sales form for you to sign.,9,22,Jim
"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.",7,15,Pam
That was you.,1,5,Darryl
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.,9,3,Pam
I'm irate right now.,5,6,Jim
Eat it Stanley!,9,7,Erin
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.,6,23,Angela
Gimme a break.,5,13,Jim
"Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.",3,17,Pam
"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...",4,12,Michael
"That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.",5,4,Andy
"I know, here we go.",4,11,Michael
"Ah, man.",7,7,Andy
What about cars?,4,2,Jim
It was a little much Andy.,6,12,Erin
"Come along, afterthought.",5,23,Dwight
Yes.,6,5,Michael
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.,9,22,Dwight
"That's not how I taught you, right? My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out",2,19,Michael
Yeah. I feel better.,9,14,Pam
Did you pee on a stick?,6,1,Michael
Who's the boy toy?,3,18,Michael
He drives an SUV!,6,5,Andy
This is dangerous.,8,18,Jim
"So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.",6,8,Michael
Twenty years.,3,2,Michael
